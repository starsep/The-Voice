“Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen,

No ID on the track let the story begin, begin, begin”



(chorus)

This is anti autotune, death of the ringtone, this ain’t for itunes, this ain’t for sing alongs,

This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde, preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song, wrong,

This aint politcally correct, this might offend my political connects,

My raps don’t have melodies, this should make jackers wanna go and commit felonies, ahh

Get your chain tooken, I may do it myself - I’m so Brooklyn.

I know we facing a recession, but the music y’all making going make it the great depression.

All y’all lack aggression put your skirt back down, grow a set man.

Yeah this just violent, this is the death of autotune, moment of silence.



(Chorus)

This ain’t a number one record, this is practically assault with a deadly weapon,

I made it just for flex and Mister CEE I want people to feel threatened

Stop your bloodclot crying, the kid, the dog everybody dying, no lying,

You boys jeans too tight, you colors too bright, your voice too light

I might wear black for a year straight, I might bring back Versace shades

This ain’t for z100, Ye told me to kill y’all to keep it 1 hundred,

This is for hot 97, for Khalid we the best’n,

Yeah this is just violent, death of autotune, moment of silence.



(Chorus)

This might need a verse from Jeezy, I might send this to the mixtape weezy,

Get somebody from BMF to talk on this, give this to a blood let a crip walk on it,

50 thou to style on this, I just don’t need nobody to smile on this,

You rappers singing too much, get back to rap you t-paining too much.

I’m a multi-millionaire so how is it I’m still the hardest here,

I don’t be in the project hallway talking about how I be in the project all day

That sound stupid to me, if you a gangsta this is how you prove it to me.

Yeah just get violent, this Death of auto-tune moment of silence.
