Bounce, bounce, bounce, Jay-Z,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella, y'all
Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella, y'all
Check, check

Yo, I'm makin' short term goals, when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to Free a big Willy
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly

Shoppin' sprees, copin' three
Deuce fever, IS's fully loaded, hehe, yes
Bouncin' in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like buddha
50 G's to the crap shooter, niggaz can't fade me

Chrome socks beamin' through my peripheral I see ya schemin'
Stop dreamin', I leave your body steamin'
Niggaz is fiendin', what's the meanin'?
I'm leanin' on any nigga intervenin'
With the sound of my money machine-in'

My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and runnin'
Y'all niggas don't want it, I got the Godfather flow
The Don Juan DeMarco, swear to God, don't get it fucked up

I'm takin' out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
'Cause you can't knock the hustle
Who do you think you are?
Baby, one day you'll be a star

Last seen out of state where I drop my slang
I'm deep in the South kickin' up top game
Bouncin' on the highway, switchin' fo' lanes
Screamin' through the sunroof 'Money Ain't A Thang'

Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam' roll tight like The Firm
Gettin' down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, burn?
We get together like a choir to acquire what we desire

We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows

What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you can't knock the hustle

But until the late thang, I'm the one who's crazy
'Cause that's the way you're makin' me feel
'Cause you can't knock the hustle
I'm just tryin' to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

Yo, y'all niggaz lunchin', punchin' the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munchin'
Sippin' Remy on the rocks, my crew, somethin' to watch
Nothin' to stop, unstoppable

Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta let you niggaz know the time like Movado
My motto 'Stack rocks like Colorado'
Auto off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle

It's a damn shame what you're not though, who? Me
Slick like a gato, fuckin' Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what

Straight bananas, can a nigga see me?
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake a rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son, you're too eager
You ain't havin' it? Good, me either

Let's, get together and make this whole world believe us, huh?
At my arrangement, screamin'
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment
Until we even, thievin' as long as I'm breathin'
Can't knock the way a nigga eatin', fuck you even

I'm takin' out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Baby, one day you'll be a star

But until the late thang, I'm the one who's crazy
'Cause that's the way you're makin' me feel
I'm just tryin' to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

Roc-A-Fella, y'all and we rule shit
Roc-A-Fella, y'all
For you can't knock the hustle
