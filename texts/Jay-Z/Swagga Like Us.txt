Mr. West is in the building
Swagger on a hundred thousand, trillion
Ayo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims
Thanksgiving do we even gotta question
Hermes Pastelle I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed
That means it's permanent, so I guess I should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on the track I asthma attack it
Why he's so mad for, why he gotta have it
Cuz I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master

Na-Na-Na, How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine Na-na-na-na-na
Trying to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

Cheaaa

No one on the corner gotta bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans cuz my knots don't fit
No one on the corner gotta pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans cuz my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by
Jocking my fresh
Jocking jocking my fresh
Jocking jocking my fresh
Follow my steps, it's the road to success
Where the niggas know you thoro
And the girls say yes
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap,
It's Hovaaaaa!
Dipping different rovers whipping with the soda
Hovaaaaa!
Could u even have any doubt after doubt if it's over

No one on the corner has swagger like moi, Church
But I'm too clean for these boys
I require what I desire I got stripes, A-di-das
Mami scream papi no mas
Run up in your shit just me no moss
Runnin this shit like I got four thighs
None has swagger like this four gods!
When it comes to styles I got several
Sharper than a swagger, dagger all metal
And my jew-elz blue and yellow
The type of shit that make em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet make you feel special
Haaa!
What the f**k you boys talking about?
I know it's us cuz we the only thing you talk about

No one on the corner have swagger like us

(Bye! )
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us


Yea

Ha!

Ya think?

That's right

You go see Weezy for the wordplay,
Jeezy for the bird play,
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy,
All my verses picture perfect and they meant to serve a purpose,
You ain't living what you kicking and you worthless,
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical,
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do,
Ain't nobody hot as me even if they rap
They ass off blast off and have outstanding qualities,
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that,
But spitting real life on hot beats I'm the truth at


You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary,
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary,

Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag
