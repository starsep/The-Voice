You are tuned in to the greatest, Young H O V
Let's go get 'em again, Just, oh my God, c'mon

Pops sped off, left Mom with a bundle of
Joy, your boy smacked dab in the jungle
Took tunnel vision but he would soon become a mogul
But first he brought that crack back like a yo-yo

Don't play with my yo-yo, loco niggas in the hood
First niggas hatin' on me, it's all good
I'm buyin' things like my shit don't stink
Gucci links in Gucci goose's
Watchin' too many movies, bulletproof this

Had some nerve, like pullin' tooth'ses
When you're 16, comin' through roofless
Yeah, your boy 'Ruthless' like Ice Cube was
Turn the whole city on, I'm the new blood

So if this is your first time hearin' this
You're about to experience someone so cold
A journey seldom seen, the American Dream
From the bottom to the top of the globe, they call me Hov

They gunnin' for me, wanna see me fall
You know my story, I've been through it all
Nights I've felt like dyin', but I ain't cryin'
What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
Iron, iron, oh my God, Hov

Now I'm knee deep in the concrete
Like the street's made of quicksand, it's beyond deep
I got a Chemical Romance, two left feet
So now I dance with the Devil, please G O D

Save me from the 'Black Parade', release me
My life like Grant Theft Auto, PSP
I'm in that Volvo, puffin' on that la-la
Duckin' from the po-po, every time I drive by

Say hi to the bad guy, all my momma friends was like
"Mmm, mmm, mmm, would you just look at him‚Äù
So sorry dear Momma for your embarrassment
But give me a couple years and pray I'll never sin again

Got all these rival dealers tryin' to do me in
And all these little rappers don't know
How prepared for them I am, I am
I'm feelin' like the world's against me, Lord
Call me crazy, but strangely, I love the odds

They gunnin' for me, wanna see me fall
You know my story, I've been through it all
Nights I've felt like dyin', but I ain't cryin'
What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
Iron, iron, oh my God, Hov

Now these baby ballers, toy rappers
Callin' out my name to bring the boy backwards
Shootin' air balls at the basket
What you call money, I pay more in taxes

I got crowned king down in Africa
Out in Niger, do you have any idea?
Sold out shows out in Seoul, Korea
Jo'burg, Dublin, Tanzania

Lunch with Mandela, dinner with Cavalli
Still got time to give water out to everybody
Everybody, fall back
Y'all rappin', I'm re-enactin'

CNN, you see, it's accurate
ESPN, see me in action
Monday Nights, when the half ends
When you 10 years in, holla back then

They gunnin' for me, wanna see me fall
You know my story, I've been through it all
Nights I've felt like dyin', but I ain't cryin'
What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
Iron, iron, oh my God, Hov

Good Lord, good Lord, good Lord
Good Lord, I said I feel like I'm dyin'
