Yeah, Roc-A-Fella, y'all know what this is
We givin' y'all five seconds to put your drinks down
An' report to the dance floor immediately
All the bustas, we givin' y'all five seconds to get close to an exit
It's about to get real ugly in here, five seconds is up, let's go

Throw the hands up
Throw the hands up, niggaz
Throw the hands up, bitches
Throw the hands up, bustas

Throw the hands up, hustlers
Throw the hands up, hos
Throw the hands up, posta's
Throw the hands up, Mac

You know how Mac come through on the club tip
Everybody real deep on that thug shit
Cop Cris' spray the club on that thug shit
Cop frisks suits, snub in the club quick

Told y'all real high, when I come through
You can try if you want to, you can die if you want to
We hittin' whores on the floor, whole crew be wild
Bitch, 'Back that ass up' like Juvenile

When my peeps come to spend a dime a piece
You know Mac come through with a line of freaks
Every bitch on the hit be a 9 at least
We gettin' head on the floor, while you grindin' freaks

Whole squad get it down like this
Whole squad buyin' rounds of Cris
Whole squad got they crowns on wrist
Whole squad got a pound of twist
Whole squad got a pound to spit
In case a clown wanna flip

Mac never slip in a club, told y'all niggas 4/5th in a club
If a nigga wanna draw, then the blood, it can drip in the club
You know how niggaz get in the club, shit, you know how I be
All high in VIP, rollin' up to B.I.G.

Niggaz be all liquored up, talkin' shit
'Til they man gotta an' come pick 'em up
Got bitches in the back bouncin' to 'Jigga what?'
You got your hands up an' I ain't even stick y'all up

Everybody get it up, throw the hands up
Everybody get it up, throw the hands up

12 A.M., on my way to the club
1 A.M., DJ made it erupt
2 A.M., now I'm gettin' with her
3 A.M., now I'm splittin' with her

4 A.M., at the waffle house
5 A.M., now we at my house
6 A.M., I be diggin' her out
6:15, I be kickin' her out

7 A.M., I'ma call my friends
12 A.M., we gon' do it again
We gon', we gon', we gon' do it again

Yo, how the fuck you gonna talk about MCs on our hill?
When we just cop them things, homey, the chromy wheels
Both arms are chunky the sleeves on chill
Any given times a 100 Gs in your grill

Don't talk to me 'bout MCs got skillz
He's alright but he's not real
Jay-Z's that deal with seeds in a field
Never fear for war, hug, squeeze that steel

Fuck, you gotta a flow, that's cool with me
You gotta lil' dough, that's cool with me
You gotta little cars, little jewelries
But none of y'all motherfuckers could fool with me

You know the wrist frostbit, minus two degrees
'Bout as blue as the sea, the way I maneuver the V
Hat cocked, can't see his eyes, who could it be?
With that new blue Yankee on, who but me

Niggaz shift two million, then I blew the three
Then I skated the four, before I went on tour
I came back an' it's plain, y'all niggaz ain't rappin' the same
Fuck the flow, y'all jackin' our slang

I seen the same shit happen to Kane
Three cuts in your eyebrows, tryin' to wild out
The game is ours, will never foul out
Y'all just better hope we gracefully bow out

Throw your hands up
Niggaz, bitches, bustas, hustlers
Fuck that
Throw the hands up

12 A.M., on the way to the club
1 A.M., 'bout to shake the butt
2 A.M., now I'm checkin' the mix
3 A.M., now he buyin' me drinks

4 A.M., exit the club
5 A.M., think he gettin' some butt
6 A.M., nigga still ain't bust
6:15, nigga will get up

7 A.M., gotta tell my friends
12 A.M., I'ma do it again, I'm, I'm, I'ma do it again
12 A.M., I'ma gonna do it again
Let's go

12 A.M., on my way to the club
1 A.M., DJ made it erupt
2 A.M., now I'm gettin' with her
3 A.M., now I'm splittin' with her

We gon', we gon', we gon' do it again
