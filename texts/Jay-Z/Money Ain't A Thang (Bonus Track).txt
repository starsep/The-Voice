Uh uh
So so def
Yeah, yeah

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out
Money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double are flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holler back
Money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean
And to hell with the price
'Cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips
Money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Slackin' on your pimpin', turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside

Tryin' to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I the chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it

Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up

Multi till I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and Jay-Z got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out
Money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double r flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holler back
Money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean
And to hell with the price
'Cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips
Money ain't a thang

Y'all wanna floss wit us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
It's slackin' on your pimpin', turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names

The big dog with the big chain, frost bit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do

Get more burnt than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no more

I'm the truth like air, got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why 'cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know bout y'all but every night I swing

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out
Money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double are flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holler back
Money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean
And to hell with the price
'Cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips
Money ain't a thang

Y'all wanna floss wit us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Slackin' on your pimpin', turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

Y'all shit ain't for real till y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&amp;B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction

Went from wholesome to jigga, you owed some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice

Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what, you went gold and Rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gonna take a lot more to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that

And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screaming it's not a game
Gleaming, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-z got it locked, crazy

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out
Money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double r flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holler back
Money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean
And to hell with the price
'Cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips
Money ain't a thang

Y'all wanna floss wit us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Slackin' on your pimpin', turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

So, so def, roc-a-fella, collabo'
You know, all we do is rock, rock on
Rock, rock on, rock, rock on
