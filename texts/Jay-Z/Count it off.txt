[Verse 1: Ms. Jade] 
You best come on, get that ass swung on 
When dem thags load on, nig-gas best hold on 
Make sure it's stick so Ricky ain't droppin' Mickeys 
My bitches puts on them quickies, and skirts gets the itchy 
Pimpin' this game quickly, and brody and niggas quit me 
For cat that talk iffy, get swung on like K. Griffey 
They spit willie, though half of the bitches feel me 
The other half is trashed, cuz words could never kill me 
I got this thick, it's ridiculous how I switch shit 
Look who I'm with, 215 and Timbaland, bitch 
Whether it's friend or foe, Heiniken, Verde, Cris or Moe 
I'm stackin' decimals, stoops, steps and best of yous 
I write mine, like mine, now I gotta spark 
All bite, no bark, play my damn part 
I get inside you, show you how Philly bitches do 
Pimp you, then I'll get rid of you, I'll shit on your whole crew 

[Chorus] 
Now let me count it off (Repeat 3x) 
Hey you, blow your whistle 
Now let me count it off (Repeat 3x) 
Hey you, blow your whistle 
Now let me count it off (Repeat 3x) 
Hey you, blow your whistle 
Now let me count it off (Repeat 3x) 

[Verse 2: Ms. Jade] 
I know it's rare, but niggas they feel me everywhere 
I'm from the land of white tees, Vickie's and Roca-Wear 
NY guys spit at cats, do-rags 
Pop it in turn it up, bang my shit in they Jags 
I got dem niggas in LA crip walkin' in the truck 
Atlanta, down south bamma's, you know they get it crunk 
Now I'ma float on, roll me somethin' to smoke on 
You hope I go away, continue to get your hope on 
Rap game, regardless I stack change 
the same affect as the game 
Ms. Jade is tha mutha-f-in' name 
I got a L-O-C-K down the freeway, BK back up to Philly 
Won't stop 'til they kill me 
I get it done, rap chicks see me and run 
Only mixin' coke with the rum 
Ain't scared, niggas be bums 
You wanna see me, beats fuck up ya hooptie 
Suburbans, Benz or the two seats 
Major numbers the first week 

Repeat Chorus 

[Verse 3: Jay-Z (during 2nd half of chorus)] 
Uh, come on with it, get down with it 
Uh, come on with it, get down with it 
Yea, it's young Vito, voice of the young people 
Roc C-E-O, hot hits for the P-O 
I'm so trill, the wood pandlin', handlin' meals 
Twenty inch jumpers from standin' on my wheels 
They can't understand it, god damnit, he's ill 
Everytime I drive, gotta prescribe 'em for panic pills 
I'm gigantic, the Titanic would never sink 
Even with the band playin', before that happend, that man sprayin' (BUCK!) 
They all fifteens, glocks and tecs 
AK's will pop, I bring ya all out the closet, girls 
Niggas is homos really, but when they smokin' on purple 
They get loco, but you know I know the drilly 
It's for these positions, that's why I keep the biscuits 
You ain't Tony Sopranno, you pussy, sleep with the fishes 
You know I'm reppin from that 7-1-8 
Shots to you f-in' son, class over, lesson's done 
HOV'!!! 

Repeat Chorus
