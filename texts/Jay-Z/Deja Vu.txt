Jay-Z Rap Intro:
I used to run base like juan pierre
now i run the base
high hat in the snare
I used to bag girls like purple bags
now i bag b
(boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn bay where they birthed me at
now b everywhere the nerver at
the audacity to have me with them curtains back
me and b, she about to steam, stand back

Verse 1:
Baby
Seem like everywhere I go
I see you
From your eyes, I smile
Its like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to
Compare nobody to you

Chorus 1:
Boy I try to catch myself
but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go

Chorus 2:
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Verse 2:
Seeing
things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming
When I saw you walkin' past me
almost called yo' name
got a better glimpse
and then I looked away
it was like i'm losing it

Chorus 1:
Boy I try to catch myself
but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go

Chorus 2:
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Jay-Z Rap Outro:
Yes
Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl you should already know
it's H-O
light up the dro
'cause you gon need help
tryna study my
bounce

flow glow
what's the difference
One you take in vein
while the otha you sniffin'
It's still dough
Po-po try to convict 'em
thats a no-go
my dough keep the scales tippin
like four-fours
like her from the H-
O-U-S-T-O-N
blow wind
So Chicago of him
is he the best ever
that's the argu-a-ment

I don't make the list
Don't be mad at me
I just make the hits
like a factory
I'm just one to one
Nuttin' afta me
No Deja Vu
just me and my...oh!

Bridge:
Baby I can't go anywhere
without thinkin' that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere it's true
Gotta be havin' deja vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane
I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
that I'm havin' deja vu

Chorus 1:
Boy I try to catch myself
but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go

Chorus 2:
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Chorus 2:
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
