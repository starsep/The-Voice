I done got in trouble again
I tried, man, I'm back 
I done got in trouble again
I done got in trouble again

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a ***
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a ***
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change

When the singer Rob calls the police on me
Y'all *** ran out and copped the CD
See what I discovered is y'all snitch lovers
I might speak but I don't *** with nobody

See what Doug, Jimmy &amp; L.A. don't know
These young'ns crossed the line with Hov, I'm lettin' it blow
Had the papers writin' stories like 'Didn't they know?
This what happen when they made that rapper CEO'

I know, it's just a matter of time before the steady hate
Starts to overflow, then the levee breaks
And my conscience go, “You escape the RICO
Why throw everything away over ego?”

You paper chasin', they paper hatin'
Billionaire Hov, you on the pace to make it
F*** that exclamation, comma, quotations
I love drama, period
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a ***
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a ***
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change

Smellin' like Patron, singin' dirty rap songs
Tip-toein' in the crib like 6 in the morn
Everyday it's the same, I said in 'Blueprint'
That I'd never change, it's just a part of the game

Respect me, I'm a thug, I might cool out for a sec
But expect me to bug, it's in my blood
But if my chick leave me, she gonna leave me for somethin'
She gone leave me 'cuz Halie, she ain't gonna leave me for nothin'

Picture me gettin' up with somethin' sleazy
Somethin' somethin' so easy, you could take out its beat like nothin'
Somethin' soon as you finish cuttin', you like, “Leave me please”
Not me, I need Angelina Jolie's company

So I ain't gonna make a move unless I got a plan B
That'll happen the day I have a baby by Free
Not to say that anythin' is wrong with Free
Just to say that ain't nothin' wrong with me

If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
I'ma take the cookie, not leave my ring
If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
I'ma take, hehe, y'all know what I mean
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a ***
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a ***
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change

You little *** ain't deep, you dumb
You *** ain't gangsta, you gum
I chew little *** ach thoo, spew little ***
I can only view little *** like little ***

But in lieu of little *** tryin' to play that boy
I phew phew little *** with the latest toy
Unlike you little *** I'm a grown *** man
Big shoes to fill *** grown *** pants

Prolly hustled with your pops, go ask your parents
It's apparent, you're starin' at a legend
Who put a few little *** in the they place before
Tryin' to eat without sayin' they grace before

Blasphemous past, get your faith restored
You're viewin' your version of the Lord
God MC, little ***, applaud or forever burn
In the fire that I spit at y'all

I rebuke you, little ***, the meek shall parish
I'll woof you, little ***, I'm a project terrorist
Cute, you little ** think you in my class
Substitute little *** soon feel my wrath

I mute you, little *** you a little ***
I shall abuse you, little *** I'm a ill ***
Now shoot, you little *** go somewhere and play
'Cuz the day I loose to you little *** no day
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a ***
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a ***
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change
