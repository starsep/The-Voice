(Yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella that's the clique)
(Nigga don't watch me better watch my bitches)


I stay sick wit
Each ??? flow like liquid shit
Harder than the dick get
Nigga flew his whole clan just to get wit
One touch nigga fiend for the clit lick
Don't leave'em nothing but a quick fix
Me and money makers be the first pick and
Do the dirt quick and
Sexy thug keep get me warm make my toes twitch
Only fuck wit the raw you should know this
Ruff Ryde, but you scared of the stallion
Scheme for cream, me and Amillion
Carry rockets in my pockets, better step back
Put holes in ya back you can bet that, hustle for the dollar
Eve, like to cut you, make you holler
Play cuts for bucks and watch'em pile up
You want more?
See me in the drop top it's on
Peach color pony head course
Player instinct, learned from my dogs
Save ya money baby I'ma take you to the mall
And I buy you something small
Maybe something negligen
Cartier, came fast in small things
What I need to survive is a peace of the pie, feel me
E-V-E, capitalize
Taking the shit, making it mine
Big niggas in the game that'll let us find
Put me up against anybody I shine
Taking my time for this line for line
Mad chart thugs wit yours crime for crime
Real bitches keeping it raw, about time

Chorus: 2xs
(Amil)
Where my hoes in this house who
Hold they niggas down who -
