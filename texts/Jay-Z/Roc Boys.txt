And the winner is Hov
My man, speech

First of all
I wanna thank my connect
The most important person
With all due respect
Thanks to the duffle bag
The Brown paper bag
The Nike shoe box
For holding all his cash
Boys in blue who put greed
Before the badge
The 1st pusher whoever made the stash
The roc boys in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling I’m feeling life
Thanks to the lames
with bad aim
Thanks to a lil change
I tore you out the game
Bullet wounds will stop your bafoonery
Thanks to the pastor rapping at your eulogy
To lil kim and them
You know the women friend
Who carry the work cross state for a gentlemen
Yeah thanks to all the hustlers
But most important to you the customer

Chorus

The Roc Boys in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling I’m feeling life
You ain’t even gotta bring ya paper out
We the dope boys of the year
Drinks is on the house
The roc boys is in the building tonight
Look at how I’m chillin
I’m killing this ice
You aint even gotta bring
Ya purses out
We the dope boys of the year
Drinks is on the house

Let ya hair down baby
I just hit a score
Pick any place on the planet
Pick a shore
Take what the Forbes figured then figure more
Cuz they forgot to account what I did with the raw
Pick a timeless
Pick apart some stores
Pick a weekend for freaking for figure fours
I figure frauds never hit a lick before
So they don’t know the feeling
When them things get across
Put ya hand out the window
Feel the force feel the porche
Hit defrost
Ice cold
Jewels got no flaws
Drop got no top
You on the top floor
Pink rose, think OJ
I get away with murder
When I sling ye
Heron got less steps than Britney
That means it ain’t stepped on dig me

Chorus

Red Porsches, rare portraits
Rare guns if you dare come near the fortress
This apple sauce is from
The apple orchid
This kind of talk is only reserved
For the bosses
Which means I get it from the ground
Which means you get it when I’m around
Rich , black bar mitzvahs
Mazel Tov, it’s a celebrations
L’Chaim, I wish for you a 100
Years of success but it’s my time
Cheers toast to the crime
#1 D boy shame he could rhyme
