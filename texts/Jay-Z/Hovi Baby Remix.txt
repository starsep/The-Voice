I fucks with Hova, I want you to know
It's something about you
I fucks with Hova, I fucks with Hova
Track master's XO, this remix is for you
Let's go

Untouchable, unbreakable, un-shakeable
(It's Hovi baby)
Can't see the un-seeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible
(It's Hovi baby)
Yes, yes, yes, baby
(Remix, it's Hova)

First I had streets, then I had charts
First I had the end, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I been here from start
I see them put it together, watch them take it apart

See the rovers roll up with the ribbons
I see them repo, resold and re-driven, so when I reload
The number one positions, when you had them hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling

When you see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cuz I'm gonna be a nigga for life
Oh this is not a gimmick
This is God given, this is harder than

Mix with cris dom sippin', this is the most consistent
Give me the most hits that you can fit inside a double disc
And hold me a pony charts, you niggas vision it
This whole edition, Jeff Gordon and rap
I'm going to claim whole position, holla at ya

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable
(It's Hovi baby)
Can't see the un-seeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible
(It's Hovi baby)

Can't move the unmovable, stop the stoppable
Top the un-toppable
(It's Hovi baby)
Yes, yes, yes, baby
(Remix, it's Hovi)

I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm about to start another life
Look behind you, I'm about to pass you twice
Back to the future, got a snow for the present
I'm fast, dude can't get passed my past

When I close the deal with the perfect present
When I unwrap the gift and the curse with a different verse
And I'm so far ahead of my time
My grandpop just met my grandma at a high school prom

And I'm so far ahead of my time, these rhymes is weak
Till four years later, they on time release
Hip hop when you take them, cop your four copa
You release A track needed a autopsy

The more tracks I'm on, the more I catch bodies
If not listen, further you're missing a murder
Like NYPD, LAPD, NYDA, OJ Jury's

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable
(It's Hovi baby)
Can't see the un-seeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible
(It's Hovi baby)

Can't move the unmovable, stop the stoppable
Top the un-toppable
(It's Hovi baby)
Yes, yes, yes, baby
(Remix, it's Hovi)

Crush linen, what's winning
If it ain't him in the flesh, continue to guess
I'm about to retire my jersey, fuck Mitchell and this
I'm gonna throw back old school kicks in

Sixty-nine yeah, same year I was born
Flip the numbers yeah, same year I got on
Ninety-six, yeah, I used to rhyme with the Don
Shit out the big, Brooklyn I got this shit

Here is something haters can't figure out
Who Vanilla first weed, man they still jigga'd out
See, I even sell CD's in the crowd
The hardest dude out since these nibble'd out

Hovi Baby, love me or blow me baby
Fuck you you'll pay me, or owe me baby
There in and out, check the charts, I'm wearing you out
I'm about to drop the black album in a year and I'm out

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable
(It's Hovi baby)
Can't see the un-seeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible
(It's Hovi baby)

Can't move the unmovable, stop the stoppable
Top the un-toppable
(It's Hovi baby)
Yes, yes, yes, baby
(Remix, it's Hovi)
