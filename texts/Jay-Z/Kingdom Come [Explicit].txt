Now I don't know what life will be in H I P H O P
(I will be, I will be)
Without the boy H O V
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor

When kingdom come, you ready?
(I will be)
When kingdom come, I'm ready
(I will be)
When kingdom come, I'm ready

Now everywhere I go, they like, “Hov, you back”
Up out the corner office, out the cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim? He was the coldest cat
Get your swag back, daddy, where your focus at?

Got to admit a little bit, I was sick of rap
But despite that, the boy is back
And I'm so evolved, I'm so involved
I'm showin' growth, I'm so in charge

I'm CEO and yeah, goin' God
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded
Sellin' blow in the park, this I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened, I might glow in the dark

Hoppin' up in the office, you might know him as Clark
But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
I take off the blazer, loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth, Superman is alive

(I will be)
The king of New York, New York
(I will be)
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor

When kingdom come, you ready?
(I will be)
When kingdom come
(I will be)
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor

I hear 'Hurry up Hov' when I'm out in the public
'Cause niggas like, "Don't you love it, you be it, you're of it
You breathe it, we need it, bring it back for the hustlas"
Had to dust off the Hammer, dance, 'U Can't Touch This'

C'mon playboys, bring your cars back out
'Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads comin' out
Got 'em dancin' on the bankhead like they from Bankhead
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinkin'

I thought dude's remark was rude, okay
So I moved on to Dom Cuvée Rose
And there's much bigger issues in the world, I know
But I first had to take care of the world, I know

I'm from the bottom, so I still feel 'em from the bottom
Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop 'em
Flash Gordon when recordin', spark the light in the dark
Peter Park, Spiderman, all I do is climb the charts

(I will be)
The king of New York, New York
(I will be)
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor

When kingdom come, you ready?
(I will be)
When kingdom come
(I will be)
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor

Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
The War-Hova, who you know took over tracks like that?
Guess what New York, New York? We back

And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was six, seventeen, been gettin' money down south
'Bout it, 'bout it, Master P
Ask the nigga, Pimp C, ask my homey, Bun B

I run the streets, the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill, still waters run deep
I repeat, sing along with me
I run the streets, the streets don't run we

Ladies sayin', “Where you been Superman?”
When niggas spendin' ten million in media on my hands
The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear
When you need me, just throw your ROC signs in the air, yeah

(I will be)
The king of New York, New York
(I will be)
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor

When kingdom come, you ready?
(I will be)
When kingdom come
(I will be)
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow, you might owe me a favor
