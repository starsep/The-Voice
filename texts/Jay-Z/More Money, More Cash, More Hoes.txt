Verse one, jay-z:

To the top wit my niggas

Drive by in whips, rock rocks wit my niggas
Break day on the hottest block wit my niggas
Just cause i (dmx)love my niggas (uh huh)
Chill wit the crew (uh huh)
Real wit the crew
4 million sold, look- still wit the crew
Break bread wit the fam
Till i'm dead wit the fam
Duck cops. shake feds wit the fam
Flip them pies wit my hustlas (uh huh)
Ride for my hustlas
Die for my, lie for my, cry for my hustlas
Roll wit my duns (uh huh)
Cold wit the guns (uh huh)

Verse three, beanie seigel:

Peep the kid from p-h-i-l-l-y
North west south west south side
Spit it for them bitches and niggas who stay fly
B-mack, roc-a-fella till i die
Met jay, dropped on a album in a week
Without unsigned hype or battle of the beats
The first time niggas heard me spit it in the streets
I gave y'all a thousand bars wit memphis bleek
Stay strapped, heat in the car under the seat
6 hammers even though we only 3 deep
We clap up niggas
Smack up niggas
Duck tape, rope, and wrap up niggas
Think shit a joke, go head crack up niggas
Get treated like coke and get capped up niggas
The only thing funny
Is y'all never seen big face money
Till them big face 20s

Chorus 2x's
