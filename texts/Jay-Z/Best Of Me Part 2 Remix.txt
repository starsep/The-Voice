(feat. Mya)

Im focused man
Tell Stout to holla at me man
Uh, young Hova, you heard
Trackmasters you heard

Yo, yes yall, Jigga man be ballin
Leave chicks pigeon-toed, some of them be crawlin
Get the best of you whenever I put my all in
Have mamis callin, for the Lord, darlin
Jigga in call and ass drop
Coupes with half the top, dispose half my knot
N**** mad when I brag about the cash I got
But Im used to not havin a lot
Im from the gutter and uh
I aint the type to ever chase your boss
Im the type to interior decorate the watch
Im the type to sling heavy weight on the block
In every state and block, word, Jiggas the hurt holla

Your lips are telling me yes, while youre kissin on my neck
Makin me feel so, should I stay, should I go, I dont know
Your hot boy style drives me wild
But in the back of mind I know

Even though I wanna see
How you put that thang on me
I cant let you get
The best of me

Even though I wanna see
How you put that thang on me
I cant let you get
The best of me

The best of me
The best of me

Conversation aint what, big thighs got you stuck
Feelings startin to show, should I stay, should I go, I dont know
Youre drivin me crazy, I wanna be your lady
But I got a man at home

Even though I wanna see
How you put that thang on me
I cant let you get
The best of me

Even though I wanna see
How you put that thang on me
I cant let you get
The best of me

The best of me
The best of me, oh...oh...

Carolina blue kicks, hottest n**** on the block
Used to Willie bicycle since I was 6, uh
High school crossover, wave to wave picks
Music aint
