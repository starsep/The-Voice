I done got in trouble again
What the fuck? I tried, man, I'm back 
I done got in trouble again
I done got in trouble again

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change

When the singer Rob calls the police on me
Y'all niggaz ran out and copped the CD
See what I discovered is y'all snitch lovers
I might speak but I don't fuck with nobody

See what Doug, Jimmy &amp; L.A. don't know
These young'ns crossed the line with Hov, I'm lettin' it blow
Had the papers writin' stories like 'Didn't they know?
This what happen when they made that rapper CEO'

I know, it's just a matter of time before the steady hate
Starts to overflow, then the levee breaks
And my conscience go, "You escape the RICO
Why throw everything away over ego?"

You paper chasin', they paper hatin'
Billionaire Hov, you on the pace to make it
Fuck that exclamation, comma, quotations
I love drama, period
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change

Smellin' like Patron, singin' dirty rap songs
Tip-toein' in the crib like 6 in the morn
Everyday it's the same, I said in 'Blueprint'
That I'd never change, it's just a part of the game

Respect me, I'm a thug, I might cool out for a sec
But expect me to bug, it's in my blood
But if my chick leave me, she gonna leave me for somethin'
She gone leave me 'cuz Halie, she ain't gonna leave me for nothin'

Picture me gettin' up with somethin' sleazy
Somethin' somethin' so easy
You could take out its beat like nothin'
Somethin' soon as you finish cuttin', you like, “Leave me please”
Not me, I need Angelina Jolie's company

So I ain't gonna make a move unless I got a plan B
That'll happen the day I have a baby by Free
Not to say that anythin' is wrong with Free
Just to say that ain't nothin' wrong with me

If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
I'ma take the cookie, not leave my ring
If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
I'ma take, hehe, y'all know what I mean
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change

You little niggaz ain't deep, you dumb
You niggaz ain't gangsta, you gum
I chew little niggaz, ach thoo, spew little niggaz
I can only view little niggaz like little niggaz

But in lieu of little niggaz tryin' to play that boy
I phew phew little niggaz with the latest toy
Unlike you little nigga, I'm a grown ass man
Big shoes to fill nigga, grown ass pants

Prolly hustled with your pops, go ask your parents
It's apparent, you're starin' at a legend
Who put a few little niggaz in the they place before
Tryin' to eat without sayin' they grace before

Blasphemous past, get your faith restored
You're viewin' your version of the Lord
God MC, little nigga, applaud or forever burn
In the fire that I spit at y'all

I rebuke you, little nigga, the meek shall parish
I'll woof you, little nigga, I'm a project terrorist
Cute, you little niggaz think you in my class
Substitute little niggaz soon feel my wrath

I mute you, little nigga, you a little nigga
I shall abuse you, little nigga, I'm a ill nigga
Now shoot, you little niggaz go somewhere and play
'Cuz the day I loose to you little niggaz's no day
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change
(I done got in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
(I done got in trouble again)
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, never gonna change
