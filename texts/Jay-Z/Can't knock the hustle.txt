I'm makin short term goals,whonder whether foes
just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
chilly with enough bail money to free a big willy
high stakes, i got more at stake than philly
shoppin sprees, copin three, duece fever i guess its fully loaded,
ah yes,
bouncin in the lex luger, tires smoke like buddha
50 g's to the crap shooter,
niggas can't fade me
chrome socks beamin, through my periphial i see ya schemin
stop dreamin',i leave ya body steamin
niggas is feenin, whats the meanin
i'm leanin on any nigga intervenin with the sound of my money machine-in
my cuff runnin over with hundreds
im one of the best niggas that done it
six digits and runnin,
y'all niggas don't want it
i got the godfather flow, the don juan demarco
swear to god, don't get it fucked up

Mary j. blige(chorus)

takin out this time
to give you a piece of my mind
(cause you can't knock the hustle)
but though you think you are
baby one day you'll be a star

that scene out of state where i drop my slang
i'm deep in the south kickin up top game
bouncin on the highway switchin 4 lanes
screamin through the sun roof money ain't a thang
your worst fear confirmed,
me and my fam roll tight like the firm
gettin down for life, thats right, you better learn
why play with fire, burn
we get together like a choir
to acquire what we desire
we do dirt like worms
produce g's like sperm
til legs spread like germs
i got extensive hoes, with expensive clothes
and i sip wine, and split ends exposed
but y'all don't know......
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
cause you can't knock the hustle

Mary J.Blige

but until that day then
i'm the one whose crazy
cause thats the way ya makin me feel
(cause you can't knock the hustle)
i'm just tryin to get mine,
i don't have the time
to knock the hustle for real

y'all niggas lunchin, punchin a clock
my function is lo make much 'n' lay back munchin
sippin remy on rocks, my crew
somethin to watch nothin to stop
un...
...stoppable
scheme on the ice, i gotta hide your crew
i gotta
let you niggas know the time like movado
my motto,
stack rocks like colorado
bottle off the champagne, cristals by the bottle
its a damn shame what ya knot though
me
slick like i got though (who?)
fuckin Jay-Z
pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
straight banana's
can a nigga, see me
got the US Open, advantage jigga
serve like sampras, play fake a rappers like a campus
(netigra???), son you're to eager
you ain't havin it? good, me either
lets get together and make this whole world believers
at my araignment, screamin
all these blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
thievin, as long as i'm breathin
can't knock the way a nigga eatin
fuck you even
