The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can’t describe what I’m feeling for real
Baby I paint the sky blue
My greatest creation was you.
You, you, Glory

False alarms and false starts
All made better by the sound of your heart
All the pain of the last time
I prayed so hard it was the last time
Your mama said that you danced for her
Did you wiggle your hands for her?
Glory! Glory! Glory! 

Sorry... Everything that I prayed for
God's gift, I wish I would've prayed more
God makes no mistakes, I made a few Rough sledding here and there, but I made it through
I wreak havoc on the world,
get ready for part two.
A younger, smarter faster me
So a pinch of Hov, a whole glass of Bé

The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can’t describe what I’m feeling for real
Baby I paint the sky blue
My greatest creation was you.
You, you, Glory

Your grand pop died of liquor failure
Then he died of liver failure
Deep down he was a good man
God damn I can’t deliver failure
Bad ass little Hov,
Two years old shopping on Saville Row
Wicked ass little Bey, hard not to spoil you rotten, looking like little me
The most beautiful-est thing in this world,
Is Daddy’s little girl.
You don’t yet know what swag is

But you was made in Paris and mama woke up the next day and shot her album package
Last time the miscarriage was so tragic,
We was afraid you disappeared but nah baby, you magic
So there you have it, sh-t happens
Just make sure the plane you on is bigger than your carry-on baggage
Everybody goes through stuff
Life is a gift, love
Open it up
You're a child of destiny
You're the child of my destiny
You're my child with the child from destiny's child
That's a hell of a recipe
Glory, glory, glory Sorry

Glory, uh, yeah

The most amazing feeling I feel,
Words can’t describe what I’m feeling for real
Baby, I paint the sky blue,
My greatest creation was you
