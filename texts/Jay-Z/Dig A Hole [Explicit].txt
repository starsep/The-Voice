Dig a hole, bury yourself, nigga
Go 'head, keep goin' I got some nice dresses
For you guys over here
The Incomparable H O

Told you to get your money when you see a boss comin'
Thought shit was funny but what you see now
Nothin' left to accomplish, I done came out of Compton
And what's that you talkin' 'bout? We gon' see now

Dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole, go 'head
Dig a hole, motherfucker, dig a hole, bury yourself
Dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole

I'm still here, mon frère, I know the cuts I bear
They like, “That's why they call you Hov”, I'm like, “Yeah”
I'm like air, little shots go through me, won't tear
Want tissue, no tears, no tissue, not an issue

Don't cry for me, I peep these niggaz from deep
Got a front row seat even if you don't speak
Silent partner, I hear you loud and clear
You left your fingerprint, you ain't got to be there

I'm just waitin' 'til you dig a hole
Big enough to put your whole body in
Then I'm gon' body them
It's nothin' but a hobby to him
Simple as serve and volley to him

Niggaz like, "Hov, why don't you get at old boy?"
Why kill a puppet and leave Geppetto alive?
Why not wait to catch 'em all together?
This way you dig one big hole one time

Told you to get your money when you see a boss comin'
Thought shit was funny but what you see now
Nothin' left to accomplish, I done came out of Compton
And what's that you talkin' 'bout? We gon' see now

Dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole
Dig a hole, go 'head, dig a hole
(Bury yourself)
Dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole
Dig a hole, dig a hole, go 'head

How that niggaz dissin' me? I made it possible
For niggaz to make history, how is this possible?
Please explain the shit to me, how is it logical?
Have we forgotten our history? Let's open our Bibles

It's like the disciples dissin' Jesus, becomin' His rivals
Shunnin' the one thing that they owed they life to
You let that man hype you to go against your idol
Knowin' good and goddamn well this what I do

Think I'm in the office, I'm off my grind
That's how kids become orphans, you lost your mind?
I keep my enemies close, I give 'em enough rope
They put themselves in the air, I just kick away the chair

Told you to get your money when you see a boss comin'
Thought shit was funny but what you see now
Nothin' left to accomplish, I done came out of Compton
And what's that you talkin' 'bout? We gon' see now

Dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole
Dig a hole, go 'head, dig a hole
(Bury yourself)
Dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole
Dig a hole, go 'head, bury yourself

Hov gon' get you, I ain't forget your lil' disrespect
No, hoe, daddy gon' spank you for that shit you said
It's hard to do when you got nothin' to prove
Everybody know you better, you in a lose-lose

'Cuz even when you win, ultimately, you lose
Real niggaz like, "Why Hov talkin' to dude?"
He sellin' little tools, only time you went plat
My chain was on your neck, that's a natural fact

So I'm prayin' that it spills outside of the booth
That's when y'all niggaz outside of your truth
Outside of your league, that's not what you do
Niggaz throwin' Roc signs outside of your Coupe

Don't look at Hov like he's done somethin' wrong to 'em
'Cuz he's onto 'em, he just took what belonged to him
Niggaz playin' checkers with chess, playin' Hov
This game is over, I don't know if you know you in a hole

Told you to get your money when you see a boss comin'
Thought shit was funny but what you see now
Nothin' left to accomplish, I done came out of Compton
And what's that you talkin' 'bout? We gon' see now

Dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole
Dig a hole, go 'head, dig a hole
(Bury yourself)
Dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole, dig a hole
Dig a hole, go 'head, bury yourself
