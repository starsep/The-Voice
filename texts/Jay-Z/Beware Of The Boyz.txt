Its the Roc in the building...

Calib, Ramel, Tarrell in the house

Yes, live from United States
Brooklyn, New York its ya boy, Young
The Neptunes is in the house

As soon as the beat drop
We got the streets locked
Overseas at Pudjabi MC and the ROC
I came to see the mamis in the spot
On the count of three, drop your body like its hot
One Young
Two you
Want to, three
Young Hov's a snake charmer
Move your body lika snake mama
Make me wanna put tha snake on ya
Im on my 8th summer
still hot
Young's the 8th wonder
All i do is get bread
Yea, i take wonder
I take one of ya chics straight from under ya arm pit
The black Brad Pitt
I mack till 6 in the AM
All day Im P-I-M-P
I am simply
Attached to tha track like simpy
Its simply good young Hov' infinitely hood

(Chorus)
R.O.C and ya don't stop
Pudjabi MC and ya don't stop
Nigga NYC and ya don't stop
It's the ROC, It's the ROC

R.O.C and we don't stop
Pudjabi MC and we don't stop
It's your boy Jay-Z and we don't stop
Nigga, ROC and we wont stop

man we see young hovse oui

Ma,' I ain't gotta tell ya
But it's your boy Hov' from the U.S.
You just lay down slow
Catch your boy minglin, England mackin in the Netherlands
Checkin in daily under aliases
We prevail is sweet back home
screamin leave Iraq alone
But all my soldiers in the field
I will wish you safe return
But only love kills war, when will they learn?
It's international Hov', been havin the flow
Before bin Laden got Manhattan to blow,
Before Ronald Reagan got Manhattan to blow,
Before I was cappin it there back before
Dro', we had it all day, Papi in the hallway, cop one of the sign to give you moye
Yeah, but that's another story
But for now, mami, turn it around and the let the boy play.
Jay...
(Chorus)
