This is a state of emergency
What you want me to do? I'm sorry, I'm back
Let's go get 'em, Just
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Show me what you got, lil' mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shawty
Show me what you got, baby

Hands up and wave
(Show 'em what you got)
And wave
(Show 'em what you got)
And wave
(Show 'em what you got)

Give the drummer some
I already gave the summer some
It's the winter's turn, Hovi Hov is the coldest
I'm just gettin' better with time
I'm like Opus One Young
No two alike like a snowflake
Okay, show me what you got, babe

Words slurrin', engine purrin'
Mami frontin' but I'm so determined
Shots of Patron, now she in the zone
I ain't talkin' about the 2-3, mami in the zone
Like the homie 2-3, Jordan or James
Make no difference we all ballin' the same

I am the Mike Jordan of recordin'
You might wanna fall back from recordin'
The s*** that you write, it's not important
So it forced him to go for the hype
For bein' brave, they may applaud him

Well misery, I will assure them
Aw baby, just ignore them
Truth or dare, mami, listen and learn
I got a drop, I just took off the top
It's your turn

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Show me what you got, lil' mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shawty
Show me what you got, baby
Hands up and wave and wave and wave and wave

Show me what you got, lil' mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shawty
Show me what you got, baby

Hands up and wave
(Show 'em what you got)
And wave
(Show 'em what you got)
And wave
(Show 'em what you got)

H O V A, gold bottles of that ace of spade
Why the fool with these other guys? They all stingy
All these dudes know how to say is “Gimme
Gimme some ***, gimme some brain
Gimme your number, gimme your name”

But if I get one night, baby girl, I swear
I'll make you tell these other dudes 'Gimme' got you here
I'll take you shoppin', take long trips
I'll take the cork off, you can take sips
I'll take you there, take my time
Take your clothes off, I'll take off mine

Ma, show me what you got
Hovi in the spot, try to told you I was hot
Tell these other dudes it's a wrap
Get the *** out the throne you clone, the king's back
Y'all got less than 2 months to get y'all thing together
Good luck

Show me what you got, lil' mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shawty
Show me what you got, baby

Hands up and wave
(Show 'em what you got)
And wave
(Show 'em what you got)
And wave
(Show 'em what you got)
And wave

Show me what you got, lil' mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shawty
Show me what you got, baby

Hands up and wave
(Show 'em what you got)
And wave
(Show 'em what you got)
And wave
(Show 'em what you got)

Ladies and gentlemen, the most incredible
H O, H O, he's back, Justin Blaze and The Blazettes
Rocafella Records, the Dynasty continues
Y'all die, peace
