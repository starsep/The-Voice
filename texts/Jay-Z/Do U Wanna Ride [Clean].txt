This is the operator with a collect call from Emory Jones
To accept the charges, press '1' now

Emory, what up? Told you I ain't too good
With writin' letters and all
I don't even write rhymes, but what I will do
I'ma send you this opus scribed through the airwaves
Vibe with me

I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do u wanna ride with me?
Do u wanna ride with me?

You know why they call 'The Projects' a project
Because it's a project
An experiment, where in it, only it's objects
And the object for us, to explore our prospects
Sidestep cops on the way to the top, yes

As kids we would daydream, sittin' on our steps
Pointin' at cars like, “Yeah, that's our sex”
Hustlers, prophets made our eyes stretch
Swanson got the spot, *** we started our trek

Some of us made it, most of us digressed
In the name of those who ain't made it my progress
Show success, please live through me
See, I'm the eyes for Emory, keep him alive

This is a collect call, so every time I press '5'
All he wanna hear is his boy talk fly
Up in the fence and still holdin' his head
So when he hits the streets, he gon' eat through this bread
Now let's ride

I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do u wanna ride with me?
Do u wanna ride with me?

International Hov, I told you so
Forty 40's out in Tokyo
Singapore, all this from singin' songs
Comin' up though, we thought slingin' ***

Was the end all be all of bein' rich, didn't we?
Little did I know my mo' potent delivery
Would deliver me, kingpin of the inkpen
Monster of the double entendre, Coke is still my sponsor

Heh, the Cola, yeah
Hova still gettin' it in with soda
Diet, no sir, I ain't lose no weight
Started from the crates, now I'm sittin' on a whole case

Since they got you sittin' on that old case
Our dreams is on hold like Tivo
So I can't wait 'til you get your date
I got some tin plates outside of the gate
We gon' ride

I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do u wanna ride with me?
