(feat. Big Boi, Killer Mike, Twista)



And we gon' stay hustlin on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin out the stores with heavy bags
Cause we poppin tags, pimpin we be poppin tags!


We arose, let's go
"So Fresh So Clean" like 'Kast
Jay-Z be poppin tags
Leavin the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
Aw fuck, there he go again
Talkin bout hoes and dough again
Yup! -- Can't hold it in
I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin, about the dough I spend
But I was holdin in, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that man
Fall back, I fought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?
Leave dudes in the rearview
V-12 engine, corners spinnin
Twinkies shinin, pinky ring
Armadale, nigga stinky stink
Top, down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma
That's right, you in luck ma
You see me cruisin down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First come, first served basis
You know Hov' be goin to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll witcha boy you'll be poppin tags

It's a party when I go up in the sto'
Shoppin while I'm zooted off the dro'
Rollin like a nigga that just came up on a mill'
and I got 'em sweepin and pickin up tags off the flo'
Bag full of clothes I remember havin rocks in the hall
on the glimmer with the gl
