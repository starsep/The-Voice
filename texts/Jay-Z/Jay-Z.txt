Ya heart pump project, ya Kool-Aid, ya sweet

I don't got a 2-Way, you gay?

This is not beef, this is rap, homie

I don't have a scratch on me,

Ya feel Jay's song, ya rip Jay off,

Damn, I'm only worth over a hundred million,

Look, I got beef with like a hundred children,

Niggas with pink suits, tryn to get cute

You a li'l outta line, homie

Don't let the nine, hold me

Put you out ya mind, homie

Just rhyme, homie

Kick ya little lot, I kick mine fast

You sneakn out the back of the source soundlab

We wasn't chasin, naw, we had to tape, too

We came thru to do our 1-2 thang

It wasn't a Roc-a-Fella come thru thang

It was all like that, Roc-a come thru clean

Ya Queens niggaz, y'all know how I do

Look, I got more shooters than Queen's Bridge and you,

Gotta tie you up on the Coliseum roof,

'n open beer bottles off the boys chip tooth

Na'Look here:



I GOT MYSELF A GUN

UH OHHH!

I GOT MYSELF A GUN
