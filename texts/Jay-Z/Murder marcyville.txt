[Chorus] 
I'm from Murda Murda Marcyville 
My nigga you heard we'll clap you, we certainly will 
South Philly muthafuckas kill at will 
I bet the Mack milli make you niggas (chilli chill) 
*Repeat* 

[Verse 1] 
Check the four corners of the earth I'm a man of respect 
Marcy projects muthafucka I'm the man of respect 
Ya'll niggaz done fucked up and called in the cleaners 
J.O. you not a felon you a misdemeanor 
Don't let the mean hit you and split your beamer 
Fuck the punks with you and hit yo team up 
Ya'll niggaz is hurt and that publicity stunt is not workin' 
Ya made a bad situation worse and 
Ya'll wanna see me I just came like rider 
You fuckas better stop the ?????? 
How the fuck you gone try us 
You can't deny us of a dollar 
It's the ROC bitch HOLLA! 
Beef ain't nothing to a boss 
Nigga you crossed the line 
The orders go out kick in yo doors 
Wavin' the 4 4's all I heard was 
Jigga I don't want it no more 

[Chorus] 
I'm from Murda Murda Marcyville 
My nigga you heard we'll clap you, we certainly will 
South Philly muthafuckas kill at will 
I bet the Mack milli make you niggas (chilli chill) 
*Repeat* 

[Verse 2] 
You heard a nigga fronted on Bleek 
Word...Nigga...Never fronted on Bleek word 
If it's written I wrote it, you spit it I spoke it 
So never forget Bleek told ya 
I'm from Murda Murda Marcyville 
When ya'll look in the mirror do ya'll see wills 
See through your Passat 
Ya'll soft like q-tip cotton 
Ya'll dudes ain't hardly real 
Ya boys spit on impulse certainly will 
If I smack this kid you'll probably squeal 
So open the Hydro we firin' still 
And we clear out the building like a fire drill 
And money too long for ya'll to fold 
You know to catch a case to me is like a common cold 
So get your guns you ain't ready for war 
You know the R-O-C is strong for ya'll 
Muthafuckas 

[Chorus] 
I'm from Murda Murda Marcyville 
My nigga you heard we'll clap you, we certainly will 
South Philly muthafuckas kill at will 
I bet the Mack milli make you niggas (chilli chill) 
*Repeat* 

[Verse 3] 
I'm in a zone you niggaz done disturbed the peace 
I try to relax and still got word off the streets and 
You frail bastards tryin' to get your name back 
You ain't achieved shit since you got your name in rap 
We can't be misjudged you hate us flows in the lyrics 
Cuz fifth slugs will tear holes in your spirit 
And it's like rap turned ya'll to kill and hustle 
Knowin' ya'll gone snitch if a hot one touch you 
Talk that gangsta slang and be a gangsta slain 
These NY MP gangstas bang 
How you talk real but you need yo click to live 
All I need is the fifth and two clips to give 
Cheater keep the unstained ratchet 
For ya'll it's where ever ya'll reign, put on your rain jackets 
It's a game ya'll ain't fit for draws wit us 
And we pop with big guns that tear through all the trucks 

[Chorus] 
I'm from Murda Murda Marcyville 
My nigga you heard we'll clap you, we certainly will 
South Philly muthafuckas kill at will 
I bet the Mack milli make you niggas (chilli chill) 
*Repeat 'til ends*
