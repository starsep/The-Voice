Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn, and I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all that's all that's all baby
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
But there's always...
That's all that's all...

This is the shit you dream about with the homie steamin' out
Back-back-backing them Beemer's out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playin' this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinkin' bout Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starving
Ain't nothin' wrong with aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of baggin' snidd-ow the size of pillows
I see pies everytime my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow

Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
It's just american dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
It's just american dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
American dreamin'
But there's always...
That's all that's all...

Now see, the life's right there
And it seems right there
It's not quite near,
And it's not like we're professionals movin' the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! got a connect? No!
Who under Heaven know how to be successful
Need a Personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode
They say it's celestial, it's all in the stars
Like Tony Caruso, how you played the card
Ya'll ain't fucking with me!
The ironies are, had all coast better before he was bars
Now lets start, on your mark
Get set, lets go-get out the car!
Going in circles, it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up, Muttley, you're dreamin' again
Your own reality show, the season begins

Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
It's just american dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
It's just american dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
American dreamin'
But there's always...
That's all that's all...

Step One in this process, scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince 'em that you not from the Precinct
Please speak slow, cause he no speakey no english
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
If your money is straight, he's gon' give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well...
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you HEALTH
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs, when the jackets is schemin'
And the cops is comin', you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time
I'm american dreamin'

Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
It's just american dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
It's just american dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
American dreamin'
But there's always...
That's all that's all...
American' Dreamin...
