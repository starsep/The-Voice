Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn
We go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard

Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard

This is black hoodie rap
There's no fear in my eyes where they lookin' at
Betta look on a map
Besides me not like ta eye fight
Me not tink such a ting is worth a man's life, right

But if a man tests my style
I promise he won't like my reply
Boom bye bye, like Buju I'm crucial
I'm a Brooklyn boy, I may take some gettin' used to

Chain snatchin', ain't have it, gotta get it
Same **** from Brownsville to Brain British
Fatherless child, mama pulled double shifts
So the number runners was the only one to hang widdeth

Before you know it, I'm in the game bang fiddeth
Feel no orangutans, peel de ol kid aps
Like a ranger is, I'm dangerous
Tell me what the name of this ****

Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard

Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
(B-R-O-OK!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
(L-Y-N come again!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
(B-R-O-OK!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
(L-Y-N come again!)

I father, I Brooklyn Dodger them
I Jack, I Rob, I sin,
Ah man, I'm Jackie Robinson
Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, Luckily they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets I'm the black Branch Ricky
From Brooklyn corners, burnin branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie, Brooklyn hippie

I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no his-story, in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returning tomorrow
The Sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half orphan, mama never had an abortion
Papa sorta did, still I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me what the ***** harder than this?

Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard

Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
(B-R-O-OK!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
(L-Y-N come again!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
(B-R-O-OK!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
(L-Y-N come again!)

Well I'm doin' my time due to circumstance
Crossed that bridge, face the consequence
Once bid 10, now I payed my dues
Risk takers we break the rules

Gets so dark, but I see good
Bedstuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now let it rain now, it's a warning
Brooklyn let it be sworn in

Gotta make you think workin' like we blue collar
Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder
Right until we quit, bring it to the floor
One step, one step, give it up more

The road is rough and the streets a mess
Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish
Robbin' out the commercial stash
To kill the voice screamin' in my head

Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard

Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard

Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Go hard, go hard
