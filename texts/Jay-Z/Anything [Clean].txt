Anything you want, girl
I bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor, girl
And I'll grant all your wishes

You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know

Specially when you bounce, bounce
I know I like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl, I like it when you bounce, bounce

Ooh, you so nasty, amateur pole dancin'
Come and get this cash from me, they call me 'Rain Man'
She tried to rain dance, money so long, it will drown you, girl
Buried under so much stacks, they had to pull back
About 50 thou before they found you, girl

I brought book bags of that bankroll
I'm a D boy, baby, they know
I'm an original D boy
They go bankrupt if they try to keep up

No roof on my car
But I got mirrors on the ceiling
I'll spread bread on the bed
Ever had sex on a million? Tell me

Anything you want, girl
I bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor, girl
And I'll grant all your wishes

You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know

Specially when you bounce, bounce
I know I like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl, I like it when you bounce, bounce

Red light, TLC, through the Left Eye, my P.O.V.
On the eye chat, how's that for computer love?
She rolled her eyes back, I'm like, “Ooh, you so nasty”
You turned my Maybach back seat into the Hotel de Paris

I ain't gotta go down to the go-go
You got a private show, that's like magic city
I got stacks of fifties, I got piles of hundreds
That's role play, act like you want it

You know, you know, you hot like fire
You throw that body, I'll throw them dollars
But not them 1's and not the 5's
Have you ever seen us go to Cleveland?
That's a thousand dollar bill, baby

Anything you want, girl
I bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor, girl
And I'll grant all your wishes

You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know

Specially when you bounce, bounce
I know I like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl, I like it when you bounce, bounce

I bet you know, you know you hot like fire
As I blow this dough, you might, could retire
Take it slow like Neo when shots was fired
In the Matrix, have patience got lots of bottles

Rock-a-bye baby, Jay-Z got notes like Mariah
Got no 1's, got no 5's, my D notes are higher
I'm a D boy, they decoys, they money is lighter
Like Nicole Richie, roll with me, they on the diet, baby

Anything you want, girl
I bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor, girl
And I'll grant all your wishes

You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know

Specially when you bounce, bounce
I know I like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl, I like it when you bounce, bounce

This is sponsored by the good fellas
U S H E R, R A Y M O N D, Skateboard P
And the J to the A to the Y to the Z, bitch
Magic City, Club Rolex, Suiz Rande, boo

And all the amateur strippers in 'robics classes
Try it out at home, it works, baby, it works
I can make it right, baby
Just put it on the floor, baby

Anything you want, girl
I bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor, girl
And I'll grant all your wishes

You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know you hot
You know, you know, you know

Specially when you bounce, bounce
I know I like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl, I like it when you bounce, bounce
