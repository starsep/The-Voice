Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
30 odd years, been 'bout havin' my cake up
So I'm 'bout my paper, 24/7, 365
366 in a leap year

I don't know why we here, since we gotta be here
Life is but a beach chair
Went from havin' shabby clothes to crossin' over Abbey Road
Hear my angel singin' to me, “Are you happy, Hov?”

I just hope I'm hearin' right, karma's got me fearin' like
Colleek are you prayin' for me, for me?
See, I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct, then the child shall have to pay

For the sins of her father, so I barter my tomorrows
Against my yesterdays and hope that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I give up my share of Carol's daughter and a new beach chair

(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna leave

(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna leave

Life is but a dream to me, gunshots sing to these
Other guys but lullabies, don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dyin', I'm afraid of not tryin'
Every day hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian

I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace
Too busy lettin' my voice vibrate
Carvin' out my space, in this world of fly girls
Cutthroats and diamond cut ropes, I twirls

Benzes 'round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope and one's grind
Son said, "Hov, how you get so fly?"
I said from not bein' afraid to fall out the sky

My physical's a shell, so when I say farewell
My soul'll find an even higher plain to dwell
So fly, you shall, so have no fear
Just know that life is but a beach chair

(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna leave
(Life is but a dream)

(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna leave
(Life is but a dream)

Life is but a dream, can't mimic my life
I'm the thinnest cut slice in a cut, the winner's cup
Well, winter's rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice

This is Jay, everyday, no compromise
No compass comes wit this life, just eyes
So to map it out, you must look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you

Chica, the corazon is what brought us home
The great shape like Heidi Klum, m*** I am on
Permanent vaca', life is but a beach chair
Song's like a Hallmark card until you reach here

So 'til she's here and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print, a map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes, so you won't lose scent

I make it stink for you to think, I ink these verses
Full of prose so you won't get conned out of two cents
My last will and testament I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair

(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna leave
(Life is but a dream)

(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna leave
(Life is but a dream)

Life is just a dream and they don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna leave
(Life is but a dream)

Life is just a dream and they don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and they don't wanna leave
(Life is but a dream)

I hear my angels sing
I hear my angels sing
I hear my angels sing
