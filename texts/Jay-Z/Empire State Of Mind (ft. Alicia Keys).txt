Yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yea I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in TriBeCa
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and... since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yea, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street.
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons whipping Pastry
Cruising down 8th Street, off white Lexus
drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say whattup to Ty-Ty, still sippin' mai tai's
sittin' courtside, Knicks &amp; Nets give me high five
Nigga I be Spike'd out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most defiinitely from....

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
InNew York, conrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're Neww Yooorrrrkkk
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York,
Neeeew Yooorrrkkkk

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
but I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
for foreigners that ain't fifty, they act like they forgot how to act
8 million stories out there, and you're naked
City is a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I gotta plug, Special Ed "I Got It Made"
If Jesus payin' Lebron, I'm payin' Dwayne Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three card monte
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the King, yo, I'm from the Empire Statue that's

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
so they can step out of bounds quick
The sidelines is blind with casualties
who sipping life casually then gradually become worse
Don't bite the apple Eve, caught up in the in-crowd
Now you're in style, end of the winter gets cold
En vogue, with your skin out,the city of sin, it's a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the cities filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say "yeaaaa, yeaaa, yeaaa, yeaaaa"

[Chorus]
