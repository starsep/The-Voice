Diamonds are forever
They are all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might desert me

+ (sample)
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive everytime I rhyme
(Forever...)
Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?


Good morning, this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, fo' real
Little was known on Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I spit the diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' 'bout the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' 'bout Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, this ain't conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin', "Keep shinin'"
How? When I know what a blood diamond 's
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your while life tryin' to get that ice
On a Polo rugby it look so nice
How can something so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight
Because




People askin' me is am I gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog, "Yo where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance that bring our reign/rain back
What's up with you and Jay, man?
Are y'all okay man?


Yup, I got it from here 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the game is intact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on but guess who ain't gon' crack
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman
I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Tiar', 'merie, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even hafta write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money, last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the red sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
A diamond is forever, I been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you waitin' for the end, the Dynasty sign
And what seem like forever is a mighty long time

+ (sample)
(Forever...)
Uh, Young, bitches
Haha
Goodnight!
