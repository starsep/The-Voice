Back at’cha 
How we do 
Premo Jigga man 
History in the making 
Let’s go 
Uh uh huh uh uh huh uh uh 
I spit the murder murder murderous 
Mu mu murderous shit uh uh uh 
I keep it gangsta gangsta ga ga gangsta fit feel me? 
I spit tha Brooklyn uh uh uh uh huh uh 

Yo career crook 
Nobody rap Brooklyn like me 
Jigga man volume three 
I’m packed looking like me 
Stop the presses 
Baby girls drop your dresses 
BK lick a shot for Big Pop in heaven 
Ever since I came through 
Niggas got the impression 
Every thing I drop out of the question 
Stop the guessing, it’s hot 
Flows proven I pack cause my dough’s movin’ 
My whole crew up in this muthafucka 
We spray corners 
Standing there like you got a cape on ya 
Fine, you’ll be wearing the black suit a long time 
I put your crew in hard bottom 
To pieces like God’s got ‘em 
He never did nothing to nobody but them boys shot ‘em 
Brandish iron, outlandish buying 
Bentley Coups, not bragging just simply the truth 
We all from the ghetto 
Only difference we go back 
Back up in DND on this Premo track 
Listen, 

I’m so gangsta prissy chicks don’t wanna fuck with me 
Ice burg, slim baby ride rims 
I’m so gutta, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
(You know him well) 
By the name of Jigga 
I’m so gangsta prissy chicks don’t wanna fuck with me 
You can love me or hate me (Jay-Z) 
I’m so gutta, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
Roc-a-fella lock the whole block down 

Wednesday I’m up to shine, cheaters Monday night 
I’m fucking with the model chicks Friday night at light 
So I’m cruisin’ in the car with this boozy broad 
Said Jigga man you rich take the do-rag off 
Hit a u-turn, ma I’m dropping you back off 
Front of the club, Jigga why you do that for? 
Thug nigga till the end tell her friend bitch 
Won’t change for no paper plus I’ve been rich 
’88 been hustlin’, linen been crushin’ ‘em 
Women been fuckin’ ‘em, huh? 
You see I live for the love of the street 
Rap to the ruggedest beats 
Hall closet cluttered with heat 
I spit that murder-murder-murder 
That Brook-brook-br-brooklyn shit 
Furthermore ma, we tote guns to the Grammy’s 
Pop bottles on the White House lawn 
I’m guess I’m just the same ol’ Shawn 

I’m so gangsta prissy chicks don’t wanna fuck with me 
Ice burg, slim baby ride rims 
I’m so gutta, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
(You know him well) 
By the name of Jigga 
I’m so gangsta prissy chicks don’t wanna fuck with me 
You can love me or hate me (Jay-Z) 
I’m so gutta, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
Roc-a-fella lock the whole block down 

I’m from the M to the A baby R-C-Y 
So it’s hard for me to let velocity die 
Niggas see me in the streets with no bodyguard 
Just two big guns that’ll body your squad 
Cause niggas be schemin’ on me, probably y’all 
Being Jigga’s a joke nigga, hardy-ha 
I spit Brook-brook-brooklyn every time I bust 
Radios gotta play me though I cuss too much 
Magazines say I’m shallow I never learned to swim 
Still they put me on their cover cause I earn for them 
As soon as I sell too much watch ‘em turn on him 
Cause that seem to be the shit that I earn from them 
I spit that murder-murder-murderous 
Every time I verbal this 
Iller than verbal Guinness or old dog a menace 
I’m ill start to finish 
I rip apart contenders I’m hot 

I’m so gangsta prissy chicks don’t wanna fuck with me 
Ice burg, slim baby ride rims 
I’m so gutta, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
(You know him well) 
By the name of Jigga 
I’m so gangsta prissy chicks don’t wanna fuck with me 
You can love me or hate me (Jay-Z) 
I’m so gutta, ghetto girls fall in love with me 
Roc-a-fella lock the whole block down 
I’m so gangsta prissy chicks don’t wanna fuck with me 
I’m so gutta, ghetto girls huh? uh, uh yeah, uh yeah 
Bump, yeah, with me, yeah, bitch, yeah, Jigga, yeah, Premo 
Yeah, gangsta, yeah, niggas, yeah, Brooklyn, yeah
