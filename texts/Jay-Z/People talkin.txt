[Sample] 
[Its like finding feathers on a housecat] 

(Jay-Z) 
Lemme take yall somewhere else right now 

[Its like searching for a needle in a haystack] 

Lemme get yall to zone out wit me, man 
(Its aight, dont be scared) 
Take yall niggaz left and center(zone out wit) 
Bullshit 

[Sample Chorus]2x 
I hear the people talk(I hear yall) 
Yes sir and when you walk(Yall hear me) 
Your kind is hard to find 
Darling, I'm glad youre mine 

(Jay-Z talking during chorus) 
Yall niggaz should twist up sumthin 
Real real real tight right here 
Zone out wit ya boy 
If you dont smoke, grab you sumthin to drink 
Mix it up right 
If you dont smoke or drink 
Man, just light up a inscense 
Fuck it 
Close ya eyes... vibe wit me 
I want yall to really hear me 

[Verse] 
I speak through music, I reach you dudes 
We can get deeper in the dirt than cleat shoes 
I refuse to lose 
I peep you creeps three months in advance 
I SEE RIGHT THROUGH YA, JUDAS! 
The man that I am and damn you dont know 
The harder you go at me the harder I flow 
Lets do this 
I'm just a mirror reflectin your image 
The minute you switch up your face I pick up the pace 
There's nothin to it 
Pull hammers from my waist 
We can clap at this amateur pace 
If that's what's crackin 
Or we can play this on All Madden 
Can you even fathom not havin a fear in the world 
I'm cool in my afterlife 
If I'm readin these chapters right 
Please what have you, I breeze through Matthews 
Bleed if I have you, you cowards die a thousand deaths 
Fate fucks face-down on your house's steps 
Are yall even gettin this message? 
I aint bein aggressive 
But if you testin my life then, shit I gotta answer 
Gotta cut off the cancer, young'n, pull your pants up 
You gettin too big for ya britches 
You fuckin wit a dude that did it wit digits 
Breathing's a privilege 
Dont you know... when youre defeated? 
Wont you throw? Throw in the towel 
I'm better with vowels 
I'm a man of principles; damn-near invincible 
In my own mind now that my soul's aligned 
I didnt know before now my role's defined: 
Take hold and control what's mine 
COME AND GIT MEEEEEEE 
Come and take my life, you comin wit me 
Come and try to take me for granted 
I'll take you off this planet 
Dammit, man this is the gift from God 
This aint have to stand 
'Til your arms are too short to box 
Plus we knuckle up unorthodox 
You can't take me off my grind GET OFF MY COCK 
Whatchu thought? It's da ROC 

[Sample]repeated 3x 
I hear the... 

(Jay-Z) 
Back in the mix of the scuffle 
Since '86 I was sick wit the hustle(Wooh!) 
Git a couple of chicks to touch you(Wooh!) 
Feather-weight fucker dont ever hate on the brothers 

(talking) 
Heh-heh 
Thought I was playin but you niggaz'll stop now 
I aint gotta sell another record in my life 
THE BLUEPRINT 2, BABY!!(Mm-hmm) 
SEE YALL IN NOVEMBER (Oh shit) 

[Sample chorus]1x 
I hear the people talk(C'MON!) 
Yes sir and when you walk(C'mon) 
Your kind is hard to find 
Darling, I'm 
Darling, I'm 
Darling, I'm 
[Fades out]
