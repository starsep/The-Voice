People was poor before the hurricane came
But the down pour poured is like when Mary J. sang
Every day it rains, so every day the pain
But ignored them and showed 'em the rains was to blame

But life is a chain, cause and effected
Niggas off the chain because they affected
It's a dirty game, so whatever is effective
From weed to sellin' kane, gotta put that in effect

Wouldn't you loot, if you didn't have the loot?
Baby needed food and you stuck on the roof
And helicopter swooped down just to get a scoop
Through his telescopic lens but he didn't scoop you

The next five days, no help ensued
They called you a refugee because you seek refuge
And the Commander-In-Chief just flew by
Did he stop? No, he had a couple seats

Just proved jet blue he's not, jet flew by the spot
What if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped?
That woulda been somethin' to watch
Helicopters doin' fly-bys to take a couple of shots

Couple of portraits then ignored 'em
He'd be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids
Poor kids just 'cause they were poor kids
Left 'em on they porches, same old story in New Orleans

Silly rappers, because we got a couple Porches
MTV stopped by to film our fortresses
We forget the unfortunate
Sure I ponied up a mill, but I didn't give my time

So in reality, I didn't give a dime or a damn
I just put my monies in the hands of the same people
That left my people stranded
Nothin' but a bandit, left them folks abandoned
Damn, that money that we gave was just a Band-Aid

You can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis, this is my minority report
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis, this is my minority report

So many times, I'm coverin' my eyes
Peekin' through my fingers, tryin' to hide
My frustration at the way that we treat
(Seems like we don't even care)

Turn on the TV, seein' the pain
Sayin' such a shame
Then tryin' to go on with my life
Of that, I too, am guilty
(Seems like we don't even care)

So we send a little money, tell 'em it's alright
To be able to sleep at night
You will pay that price
While some of these folks' lost their whole life
(Seems like we don't even care)

Now it wasn't on the nightly news no more
Suddenly, it didn't matter to you no more
It went in, almost nothing changed
What the hell, what was that for?
(Seems like we don't even care)

Seems like we don't even care
Seems like we don't even care
