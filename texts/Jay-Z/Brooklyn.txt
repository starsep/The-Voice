Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn…
We go hard
We go hard

Chorus:
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (repeated in background)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
(Repeat 6X more)
Jay-Z: Ard go hard

(Jay-Z) Verse 1:
This is black hoodie rap,
There’s no fear in my eyes where they’re lookin at.
betta look a map
be-sides me not like ta eye fight
me not think such a ting is worth a man’s life,
but if a man tests my style,
I promise he won’t like my reply
boom bye bye, like Buju I’m crucial
I’m a Brooklyn boy, I may take some gettin’ used to
change snatchin, ain’t have it, gotta get it
same **** itd from Brownsville to Great British
fatherless child, mama pulled double shifts
so the number runners was the only one to hang widdeth
before u know it, i’m in the game bang fiddeth
feel no orangutans peel-deel kid-aps
like a ranger is, i’m dangerous
tell me what the name of this shit

Chorus:
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (repeated in background)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
(Repeat twice more)…
B-R-O-OK!
L-Y-N come again!
(Repeat again)

Jay-Z Verse 2:
I father, I Brooklyn Dodger them
I Jack/ I Rob/ I sin,
Ah man, I’m Jackie Robinson
‘cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, Luckily they didn’t get me
Now when I bring the Nets I’m the black Branch Ricky
From Brooklyn corners, burnin branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie, Brooklyn hippie
I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T,

with no his-story, in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returning to-morrow
The Sun don’t come out for many, like Annie
half orphan, mama never had an abortion
papa sorta did, still I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
now please tell me what the ***** harder than this?

Chorus:
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (repeated in background)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
(Repeat twice more)…
B-R-O-OK!
L-Y-N come again!
(Repeat again)

Santogold:
Well I’m doin my time due to circumstance
Crossed that bridge, face the consequence
Once bid 10, now I payed my dues
Risk takers we break the rules.
Gets so dark, but I see good.
Bedstuy stay high in my neck of the woods.
Now let it rain now, it’s a warning
*Brooklyn* let it be sworn in
Gotta make you think workin like we blue collar
rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder
right until we quit, bring it to the floor
One step, one step, give it up more
the road is rough and the streets a mess
got big cash dreams and a sick death wish
robbin out the commercial stash
to kill the voice screamin in my head

Chorus:
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (repeated in background)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
(Repeat twice more)…
B-R-O-OK!
L-Y-N come again!
(Repeat again)…
Go hard, go hard
