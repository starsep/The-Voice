[Jay-Z]
You know I
Thug em
Fuck em
Love em
Leave em
Cause I don't fuckin' need em
Take em out the hood
Keep em looking good
But I don't fuckin' feed em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talking 'bout
What's the reasons
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe em
In a cut where I keep em
'Til I need to nut
'Til I need to be the gut
Standing, deep deep then I'm picking em up
Let em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cup
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just be cause you got good head
I'ma break fair
So you can be livin' it up
Shit I, prospered nothin'
Y'all be frontin'

Not for nothin'

Hardcore than assassins

Nigga it's the
Big southern rap pimp resario
Coming straight up out the black bar-io
Makes a Mil up off a sorry hoe
Then sit back and peep my scenario
Oops, my bad, that's my scenario
No I can't fuck with scary hoe
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoe's stop boy
And they say "There he go!"
Now these muthafuckas know we carry more heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book you illiterate son of a bitches
They'll fuck your vocab
Don't be surprised if your hoe's there out with me
And you see us coming down your slab
Nigga ghetto fabulous so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hate now, then you ain't wild
I'll get your bitch butt naked
Just break it
You gotta pay like you ain't wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get your ass to the back
As I fast to the track Timbaland let me spit my pro's on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breaking these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flow's on
When the shit get's hot
Then the glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigga-man
Who really don't get no bigger man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' thrown on the flip
Then blow with the muthafuckin' Jigga-man
Fool
