It's that Rocafella music...
Soulful...

Say hello
To the bad guy
Hello
They say I'm a bad guy
I come from the bottom
But now I'm mad fly
Say Hello
They say I'm a menace
That's the picture they paint
Hello
They say a lot about me
Let me tell ya what I ain't
Hello
They say I'm a bad guy
Say Hi to the bad guy
Hello
I come from the bottom
But now I'm mad fly
They say I'm a menace
That's the picture they paint
They say a lot about me
Let me tell ya what I ain't
Say hello
Hello
Ay, ay, ay, ay
They say a lot about me
Let me tell you what I ain't

I ain't playing,
Life's short, so I aint
I ain't waiting for life to start portrayin' em
It's twice as hard to get a job that's paying
So I ain't payin' attention to what you saying
Rain-drops keep falling on my brain
Cousin in the drop on flames
I'm so hot even if the weather change
I don't have no top, I'm insane
Remember darkskinned Jermaine?
Suede in the rain, I'm sorta kinda the same
Except I'm no lame and you gonna know my name
Before I go to work and feel my pain
Saying, I'm a bad guy, why's that?
Cause when my back's against the wall, nigga, I react
Secretly though, I know you admire that
You wish you had the balls to fire back, prrrrat
Say hello, uh, uh, hello, uh. uh
You wish you had the balls to fire back, prrrrat

Say hello
To the bad guy
Hello
They say I'm a bad guy

But now I'm mad fly
Hello

They say a lot about me
Let me yell ya what I ain't
Hello
They say I'm a bad guy
Say Hi to the bad guy
Hello
I come from the bottom
But now I'm mad fly
They say I'm a menace
That's the picture they paint
They say a lot about me
Let me tell ya what I ain't
Say hello
Hello
Ay, ay,
They say a lot about me
Let me tell you what I ain't

I ain't no ordinary nigga
Look around, this aint what 'ordinary' gets ya
Extraordinary figures
I'm an extra-ordinary nigga
Before my name became Jigga
Before I sang, I had that thang on zippers
Can't complain bout what they ain't gon' give ya
That ain't gon' get you shit, mightaswell give up
Or get up, get out and get something, nigga
Get a job, my nigga, or get to dumping
Only God can judge him, only he without sin
Can tell me if my means can justify my ends
Til' then, I'm just gon' fly in the benz
Wire my friends through Western Union
Sssshhhh... surprising my system knockin'
Here comes the bad guy again!
Say hello
Uh uh
Hello
Uh uh
Hello
Here comes the bad guy again

Hello
Ay, ay,
They say a lot about me
Let me tell you what I ain't

We ain't thugs for the sake of just being thugs
Nobody do dat where we grew at, nigga, DUH!
The poverty line, we not above
So out come the mask and glove cause we ain't feelin' the love
We ain't doing crime for the sake of doing crime
We movin' dimes cause we ain't doin' fine
One out of three of us is locked up doing time
You know what that type of shit can do to a nigga mind?
My mind on my money, money on my mind
If you owe me ten dollars, you ain't giving me nine
Ya'll ain't give me 40 acres and a mule
So I got my Glock 40, now I'm cool
And if Al Sharpton is speaking for me
Somebody get him the word and tell him I don't approve
Tell him I'll remove the curses
If you tell me our schools gon' be perfect
When Jena 6 don't exist
Tell him THAT's when I'll stop saying bitch - BIIITCH!
