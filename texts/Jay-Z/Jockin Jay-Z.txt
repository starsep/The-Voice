Who's house? hov, no doubt
Bout the only rapper
Still gettin money in the drought
I moves out in the global, I'm a mogul
50, 000 feet in the air
And I'm still on my mobile
Fuck talking bout the recession it's depressin
I rock ith obama but I'm not a politician
And I chill with the thugs and the gangsters thoo
I ain't a blood
But I'm warring with the boys in blue
Crooked officer, crooekd officer
Why you wanna see me in a coffin sir
Is it against the law the way 'm flossin sir
Benzes rolls royces and porschesm, ughhh
Hater's like
"hov why you still talkin money shit?"
Cuz I like money, bitch
I like fly shit, you like gossip
I let you do you, why you ridin my tip?

That bloke from Oasis said I couldn't play guitar
Somebody shoulda told him I'm a fuckin rock star
Today is gonna be the day
That I'm gonna throw it back to you
I'm livin life as a rocker I'm like pimp c, potna
Comin down in mercedes peelin off on the boppers
Worldwide show I'm comin down in a chopper
180 thou, screamin Hov with the Roc up
It's too easy, I got ladies on soldiers
Showing me their chi-chis(?)
I mee honey at the show last year
And now I'm acting brand new
Like a world premiere
Yeah I know life ain't fair
But chill babygirl, my girl is here
I got models in the moshpit
Dancin off beat
But they know the words to my shit

You ain't gotta jock jay-z jock fly shit
You ain't gotta jock me, homey jock my chick
Jock her she body you with the fit
No that's not pilates, her body just thick
You ain't gotta jock her, nigga jock my clique
Jock the dope boys cuz we all toss bricks
Federale's jock while I'm crossin the bridge
Click click, take a portrait of this
I ain't no pretty boy, I got a gorgeous wrist
Cut handsome checks and my flow's pretty sick
I'm so ghetto chic
I'm where the hood and high fashion meet
Ooh-wee, I'm like the camouflage 
How you niggas want it, the tux or the toolie
Haters I ain't mad at you
If I wasn't me I'd probably jock me too
