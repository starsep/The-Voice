Ay 
Ay 
Ay (Nobody likes to be played) 
Oh, Beyonce, Beyonce 
Oh, Shakira, Shakira 

(Hey!) 

He said, I'm worth it, his one desire 
(I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about) 
He kissed me, his one and only 
(This) Beautiful liar 
(Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about) 

You'll never know 
Why are we the ones who suffer 
Have to let go 
He won't be the one to cry 

(Ay) Let's not kill the Karma 
(Ay) Let's not start a fight 
(Ay) It's not worth the drama 
For a beautiful liar 
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it (Ha ha ha) 
(Oh) It's not worth our time 
(Oh) We can live without him 
Just a beautiful liar 

I trusted him 
But when I followed you 
I saw you together 
(I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again) 
I walked in on your love scene 
Slow dancing 
(You stole everything how can you say I did you wrong) 

We never know 
When the pain and heartbreaks over 
Have to let go 
The innocence is gone 

(Ay) Let's not kill the Karma 
(Ay) Let's not start a fight 
(Ay) It's not worth the drama 
For a beautiful liar 
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it (Ha ha ha) 
(Oh) It's not worth our time 
(Oh) We can live without him 
Just a beautiful liar 

Tell me how to forgive you 
When it's me who's ashamed 
And I wish I could free you 
Of the hurt and the pain 
But the answer is simple 
He's the one to blame 

(Hey!) 

Ay, Beyonce, Beyonce 
Ay, Shakira, Shakira 
Oh, Beyonce, Beyonce 
Oh, Shakira, Shakira 
(Hey!) 

(Ay) Let's not kill the Karma 
(Ay) Let's not start a fight 
(Ay) It's not worth the drama 
For a beautiful liar 
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it (Ha ha ha) 
(Oh) It's not worth our time 
(Oh) We can live without him 
Just a beautiful liar
