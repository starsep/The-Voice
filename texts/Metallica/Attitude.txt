Suppose I say, I'm never satisfied
Suppose I say, you cuts the roots
To make the tree survive
Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm oh so born to die
Ohhhh, i hunger
I hunger
I eat
Born Into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
I get a fever, what ever happened to sweat
Suppose I say, the vultures smile at me
Suppose I say, I set them down they plan to pick you clean
And satifaction this way comes
And satifaction this way comes
And satifactions here and gone
gone, yeah gone again
Ohhhh, I hunger
Ooh I hunger
I eat
Bron Into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there
Born Into Attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
I get a fever, what ever happened to sweat?
Solo
Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once for me
I'm born to die
And satifaction this way comes
And satifaction this way comes
And satifactions here and gone
gone, gone again
Yeah I hunger
Ohhh I hunger
I eat
Born Into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there
Born Into Attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throwing all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
I get a fever, what ever happened to sweat
