And it feels right this time 
On this crash course we're in the big time 
Pay no mind to the distant thunder 
Beauty fills his head with wonder, boy.... 

Says it feels right this time 
Turn around, found new high lights 
Good day to be alive Sir 
Good day to be alive, he said..... 

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel 
is just a freight train coming your way 
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel 
is just the freight train coming your way 

Don't it feel right like this 
All the pieces fall to his wish 
Suck up for that quick reward boy 
Suck up for that quick reward they said..... 

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel 
is just a freight train coming your way 
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel 
is just the freight train coming your way...... 
It's coming your way 
It's coming your way...... 
Here comes 

Yeah, Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel 
Is just a freight train coming your way.... Yeah... 
Then it comes to be, Yeah... 
Then it comes to be, Yeah... 
Then it comes to be, Yeah... 
Then it comes to be, Yeah... 
Then it comes to be, Yeah... 
Then it comes to be, Yeah... 
Then it comes to be, Yeah... 
Then it comes to be, Yeah
