You think you see me 
In the glass 
You think you hear me 
Better listen fast 
I think I see you 
Gone to seed 
I hear your reason 
Is your guilt and greed 

You're out there on your own 
Your face turned to stone 
What ever happened to your life? 
Stone dead forever 
All right 

You're a financial wizard 
Yeah, a top tycoon 
You're a sweet long lizard 
With a silver spoon 
You know you've never had it 
Quite so good 
And you didn't know 
That you even could 

Your time has come to own 
Your touch turned to gold 
What ever happened to your life? 
Stone dead forever 
All right 

It's been a long time 
It's been a long long wait 
And you caught your fingers 
In the pearly gates 
You better leave your number 
And we'll call you 
You know your problem 
Ain't exactly new 

Your time has come today 
Your face has turned to hey 
What ever happened to your life? 
Stone dead forever 
That's right
