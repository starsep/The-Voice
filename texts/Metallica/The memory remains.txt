Fortune, fameMirror vainGone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd
Cry the nowhere cheers of honor
Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light of an already
Faded prima donna

Fortune, fameMirror vainGone insane..
.Fortune, fameMirror vainGone insane...
But the memory remains

Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets
Behind your back
And can't the band play on
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash Dust to dust Fade to black

Fortune, fameMirror vainGone insane..
.Fortune, fameMirror vainGone insane...
Dance little tin goddess

Drift awayFade away
Little tin goddess
Ash to ash Dust to dust Fade to black

Fortune, fameMirror vainGone insane...
Fortune, fameMirror vainGone insane...
But the memory remains

Ash to ash Dust to dust Fade to black...
But the memory remains
Dance little tin goddess dance
