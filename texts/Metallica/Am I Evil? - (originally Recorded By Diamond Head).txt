My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried.
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
Take my time.

See their bodies out on the ice.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.

Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.

See their bodies out on the ice.
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Take my time.

Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.
Am I evil? Yes I am.

On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.

. Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own

Am I evil? I am man.
Am I evil? Yes I am.

My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
Am I evil? Yes I am.

Am I evil? I am man.

Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah
