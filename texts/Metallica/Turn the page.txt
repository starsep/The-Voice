On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha 
You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one note song 
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before 

But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do 
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' much to do 
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through 

Here I am 
On the road again 
There I am 
Up on the stage 
Here I go 
Playin' star again 
There I go 
Turn the page 

So you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road 
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold 
You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode 

The most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can 
All the same old clich√©'s, "Is that a woman is it a man?" 
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand (make a stand) 

Here I am 
On the road again 
There I am 
Up on the stage 
Here I go 
Playin' star again 
There I go 
Turn the page 

Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away 
Every ounce of energy you try to give away 
As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play 

Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed 
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head 
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said (what she said) 

Here I am 
On the road again 
There I am 
Up on the stage 
Here I go 
Playin' star again 
There I go 
Turn the page 
Here I am 
On the road again 
There I am 
Up on the stage 
Here I go 
Playin' star again 
There I go 
There I go
