Die, Die, Die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, Die, Die my darling
Just shut your pretty eyes
I'll be seeing you again
I'll be seeing you in hell

chorus:
Don't cry to me oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box, yeah
Don't cry to me oh baby
Should have seen it a-coming on
Don't cry to me oh baby
I don't know it was in your power
Don't cry to me oh baby
Dead-end girl for a dead-end guy
Don't cry to me oh baby
Now your life drains on the floor
Don't cry to me oh baby

Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth
I'll be seeing you again
I'll be seeing you in hell

chorus

Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth
I'll be seeing you again
I'll be seeing you... in Hell
