One Two Three Four 

If you think you can, well come on man 
I was a Green Beret in Viet Nam 
No more of your fairy stories 
'Cause I got my other worries. 

53rd and 3rd 
Standing on the street 
53rd and 3rd 
I'm tryin' to turn a trick 
53rd and 3rd 
You're the one they never pick 
53rd and 3rd 
Don't make you feel sick ?

Then I took out my razor blade 
Then I did what God forbade 
Now the cops are after me 
But I proved that I'm no sissy
