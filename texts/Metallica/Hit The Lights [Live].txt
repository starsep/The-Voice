No life till leather
Gonna kick some ass tonight
Got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
'It's right', well, alright

When we start to rock
We never stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

Know fans are insane
Gonna blow this bitch away, yeah
With volume higher
Than anything today, the only way

We start to rock
We never stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

With all our screaming
Gonna rip through your brain
Lethal power
Causing you sweet pain, oh, sweet pain

When we start to rock
We never stop again, oh

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
