Imagine you at my station
and you brought your motor to me
you´re a burner yeah
a real motorcar
you said you wanna get your order filled
make me shiver when you put it in
pumping just won´t do any luck for you

Who ever thought you´d be better
at turning screws than me
I do it for my life
make my drive shaft crack
make my pistons buldge
make my ball barring melt from the heat

We were shifting hard when we took off
out tonight all four on the floor
when we hit top end you know it feels too slow
you said you wanna get your order filled
make me shiver when you put it in
pumipng just won´t do any luck for you

Who ever thought you´d be better
at turning screws than me
I do it for my life
make my drive shaft crack
make my pistons buldge
make my ball barring melt from the heat

I´m giving you my room service
and you know it´s more than enough
oh one more time I know I´m in love
imagine you at my station
and you brought your motor to me
you´re a burner yeah
a real motorcar

Who ever thought you´d be better
at turning screws than me
I do it for my life
make my drive shaft crack
make my pistons buldge
make my ball barring melt from the heat
