Yeah, I feel you too
Feel, those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns,
Just for you
That's running through

Deep inside you know,
Seeds I plant will grow

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me,
Yeah come on come on now take the chance

That's right
Lets dance!

Snake, I am the snake
Tempting, that bite you take
Let me make your mind,
Leave yourself behind
Be not afraid
I've got what you need,
Hunger I will feed

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Come on, come on now take the chance

HaHa!
Come dancin'!

Come dancin

(Gitarrensolo)

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah come on, come on now take the chance

(Noch n solo)

Yeah, I feel you too
Feel, those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns,
Thats running through
Deep inside you know,
Seeds I plant will grow
One day you'll see
And dare to come down to me
Come on, come on now take a chance
That's right
Let's dance!
It's nice to see you here,
HAHA!!!
