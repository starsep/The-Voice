I won't go away
Right here I'll stay

Stand silent in flames
Stand tall 'till it fades

Shoot me again
I ain't dead yet

Shoot me again

All the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you

All the shots

All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you

I won't go away, with a bullet in my back
Right here I'll stay, with a bullet in my back

Shoot me
Take a shot

I'll stand on my own, with a bullet in my back
I'm stranded and sold, with a bullet in my back
