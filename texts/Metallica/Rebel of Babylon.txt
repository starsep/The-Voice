Rebel, grip your bottle tight, just float away
Rebel, is it hard to leave? What makes you stay?
Go take your poison ink - sign life away
Then take your dirty spoon and dig your grave
Dig your grave...

Rebel grips the bottle tight, just floats away
Rebel finds it hard to leave, what makes you stay?
He takes the poison ink signing life away
Then takes the dirty spoon and digs his grave

Let this dark shine, let this dark shine
Let it shine bright, don't let it burn out tonight

Kill me one more time stigmata
Kill me one more time neo-martyr
Gonna die young, gonna live forever
Kill me one more time
Rise up rebel of Babylon

Renegade fights the fight that no one wins
He claims a crown of thorns to pierce the skin
He climbs his crucifix and waits for dawn
Thinks they'll remember him after he's gone

Let this dark shine, let this dark shine
Let it shine bright, don't let it burn out tonight

Kill me one more time stigmata
Kill me one more time neo-martyr
Gonna die young, gonna live forever
Kill me one more time
Rise up rebel of Babylon

Rise up
Rise up
Resurrection

The rebel fights the fight that no one wins
To claim a crown of thorns to pierce his skin
Climbs his crucifix and waits for dawn
He loses consciousness, the myth lives on

Let this dark shine, let this dark shine
Let it shine bright, don't let it burn out tonight
Tonight!

Kill me one more time stigmata
Kill me one more time neo-martyr
Gonna die young, gonna live forever
Kill me one more time
Rise up rebel of Babylon

Rise up
Rise up
Resurrection
