Man in black comes around
Blacks the light
Blacks the sound
Fear the thought of it never ever coming back
Leave the shift to the round
Open up your gate
Spirit dialate
Watch the falling sand
Shifting through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dialate
Whisper To Your Friends
Death Is Not The End!
Not the End
Not the End
It's the beginning
It's a'
Paid my dues in the cell
Be the toll of the bell
Dearly beloved
We gathered here today
To say goodbye to our old selves
Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dialate
Watch the falling sand
Slipping through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dialate
Go tell all Your Friends
Death Is Not The End!
Not the End
Not the End
It's the begining
I've been a rambler, the light changes me
I've been a rambler, the light sets me free
Sets me free
*Guitar Solo*
Yeah!
I've been a rambler the light sets me free
I've been a gambler the light sets me free
Sets me free
Haha!
Man in black comes around
Blacks the light
Blacks the sound
Dearly beloved
We gathered here today
To say goodbye to our old selves
Open up your gate
Spirit dialate
Watch the falling sand
Slipping through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dialate
Go Tell all Your Friend
Death Is Not The End!
Not the End
Not the End
It's the begining
Death is not the end!
