Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash, crash my head
Natural joker, paint me dead
And I see red

Running across through black and white
War horse, war head
Fuck 'em, man
White knuckles tight
Through black and white

Oh, I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard
Loose and clean

And then I burn
Turning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out hope
Burn your face upon the chrome

Take the corner, going to crash
Headlights
Headlines
Another joker, who lived too fast

Lives way too fast, fast, fast, fast, fast

When I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean

And then I burn
Turning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
My desire

When I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean

And I burn,
Turning my direction,
Quench my thirst with gasoline

Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

And I burn
