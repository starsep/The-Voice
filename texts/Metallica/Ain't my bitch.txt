Outta my way,
outta my day
Outta your mind and into mine
Into no one, into no one
Into your step but outta time

Head strong, what's wrong?
I've already heard this song
Before ... you arrived
But now it's time
To kiss your ass good-bye

Draggin' me down, why you around?
So useless
It ain't my fall, it ain't my call!
It ain't my bitch

Down on the sun, down and no fun
Down and out, where the hell ya been
Damn it all down, damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again

Stand tall, can't fall
Never even bend at all
Before .. you arrived
But now it's time
To kiss your ass good-bye

Draggin' me down, why you around?
So useless
