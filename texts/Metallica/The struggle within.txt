Reaching
out for something you've got to feel
while clutching to what you had thought was real

kicking at a dead horse pleases you
no way of showing your gratitude
so many things you don't want to do
what is it? what have you got ot lose

what the hell
what is you think you're gonna find?
hypocrite
boredom sets into the boring mind

struggle within it suits you fine
struggle within your ruin
struggle within you seal your own coffin
struggle within the struggling within

home is not a home it becomes a hell
turning it into your prison cell
advantages are taken, not handed out
while you struggle inside your hell

reaching out
grabbing for something tou've got to feel
closing in
the pressure upon you is so real

struggle within it suits you fine
struggle within your ruin
struggle within you seal your own coffin
struggle within the struggling within

reaching out for something you've got to feel
while clutching to what you had thought was real
what the hell

what is you think you're gonna find
hypocrite
boredom sets into the boring mind

struggle within it suits you fine
struggle within your ruin
struggle within you seal your own coffin
struggle within the struggling within
