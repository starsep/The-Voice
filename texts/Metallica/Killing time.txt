The sound of gunfire goes through the night 
The killing and hatred's a terrible sight 
Reports come in of a heavy attack 
Message recieved, we're moving back 

Preparations are made for the journey back 
Hints on survival, supplies are packed 
No more nights in this eternal hall 
Destination is simple, we move out 

Killing time, your life's on the line 
Killing time, your turn to kill 
Killing time, what d'ya say? 
Killing time, ah killing time 

Ingenuity needed to keep us alive 
No time for cowardice, kill &amp; survive 
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife 
Nasty word, he'll take your life 

The silence is over the attack again 
The killing &amp; hatred, drive me insane 
Reports come in of a savage attack 
Message received, we're moving back
