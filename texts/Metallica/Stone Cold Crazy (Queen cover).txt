Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone.
Rumor going round, gotta clear out of town,
smelling like a dry fish bone.
Here come the law, gonna break down the door,
carry me away once more.
Never, never, never want it anymore.
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.

chorus
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon, on a killer typhone,
and it's a playing with my slide trombone.
Any more, anymore, can't take it anymore.
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

chorus

Walking down the street, shooting people thati meet,
full loaded tommy gun.
Here come the deputy, try fukin' gittin' me,
gotta get up and run
They got the sirens lose, I'm running out of juice.
They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell.

chorus
