Guilty as charged
But damn it, aint right
There is someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
Ill take your life from you!

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath

No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
Its right well all right
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

You know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today the only way
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

Time
Has taken it's toll on you
The lines that crack you face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening waiting for his whips
Your bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on you lips

Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With this sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Victims falling under chains
Your hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With this sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
Fight fire with fire (repeat)
