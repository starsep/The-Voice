James Hetfeild:Little boy, your going to hell!
You said bad words, threw rocks at the bird
And now, this is your hotel
You ain't going back, this ain't disneyland, it's HELL

Little boy, it's time for you to pay!
For hurting that bird, and not going to church
And staring at boobs everyday
Now you must stand in HELL!

Hell isn't good, hell isn't good, HELL!
No, hell isn't good, hell isn't good,HELL!

Adolf Hitler: something in german...
George Burns: Hey fuckface, have you seen Gracie?
Mahatma Ghandi: There is orderliness in the universe
James Hetfield: Hell isn't good, hell isn't good, HELL!
