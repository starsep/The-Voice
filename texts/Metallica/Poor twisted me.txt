Oh poor twisted me
Oh poor twisted me
I feast one sympathy
I chew on suffer, I chew on agony
Swallow whole the pain
Oh it's too good to be
That all this misery
Is just for oh poor twisted me

Poor mistreated me
Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
Lung fills with sorrow, lungs full with misery
Inhaling the deep dark blue
Oh woah is me
Such a burden to be
The poor mistreated me

To finally reach the shore
Survive the storm
Now you're bare and cold
The sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again

Good to feel my friend
Oh woah is me
Such a burden to be
Oh poor tiwsted me
