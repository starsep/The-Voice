Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse,
Breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch,
Open up your bones, never, never gonna lose it.
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Gotta make a mint, gotta make me a million.
Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man,
Loser, give it all away, never stay with the winner,

Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be.
With the man with all the filthy money.
Come on, keep it on the side, with a ride on a record,
Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.
On the top if you're gonna be a bad boy.

Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man,
Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be.
