So wake up sleepy one... 
It's time to save your world... 

Steal dreams and give to you 
Shoplift a thought or two 
All children touch the sun 
Burn fingers one by one, by one... 

Will this earth be good to you 
Keep you clean or stain through.... 

So wake up sleepy one... 
It's time to save your world... 
You're where the wild things are... 
Yeah, toy soldiers off to war... 

Big eyes to open soon 
Believing all under sun and moon 
But does heaven know you're here? 
And did they give you smiles or tears? 
No, no tears 

Will this earth be good to you? 
Keep you clean or stain through.... 

So wake up sleepy one... 
It's time to save your world... 
You're where the wild things are... 
Yeah, toy soldiers off to war... 

Solo 

(Backing Vocals) 
You swing your ?ass all down? 
Call to arms the trumpets sound 
Toy horses start the charge 
Robots, chessmen standing guard 
We Shall Never Surrender!!!! 
Hand puppets storm the base 
Flags up now cannons rage 
Hand puppets storm the base 
Flags up now cannons rage 
All clowns head for the rear 
Slingshots fire to the air 
All clowns head for the rear 
Slingshots fire to the air 
Slip into the edge of death 
Crossfire to the marionettes 
Slip into the edge of death 
Crossfire to the marionettes 
We Shall Never Surrender!!!! 

All children touch the sun 
Burn your fingers one by one 
Will this earth be good to you? 
Keep you clean or stain through.... 

So wake up sleepy one... 
It's time to save your world... 
You're where the wild things are... 
Yeah, toy soldiers off to war... 

So close your little eyes...
