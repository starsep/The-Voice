MAKE HIS FIGHT ON THE HILL IN THE EARLY DAY
CONSTANT CHILL DEEP INSIDE
SHOUTING GUNS ON THE RUN THROUGH THE ENDLESS GREY
ON THE FIGHT ; FOR THEY ARE RIGHT ; YES ; BY WHOS TO SAY
FOR A HILL MAN WOULD KILL ; WHY THEY DO NOT KNOW
SUFFERED WOUNDS TASTE THEIR PRIDE
MAN OF FIFE STILL ALIVE THROUGH THE RAGING GLOW
GONE INSANE FROM THE PAIN THAT THEY SHURLY KNOW

FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS
TIME MARCHES ON
FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS

TAKE A LOOK TO THE SKY JUST BEFORE YOU DIE
IS THE LAST TIME YOU WILL
BLACKENED ROAR MASSIVE ROAR FILLS THE CRUMBLING SKY
SHATTERED GOAL FILLS HIS SOUL WITH A RUTHLESS CRY
STANGER NOW ; ARE HIS EYES ; TO THIS MYSTERY
HE HEARS THE SILENCE SO LOUD
CRACK OF DAWN ; ALL IS GONE EXCEPT THE WILL TO BE
NOW THEY SEE WHAT WILL BE ; BLINDED EYES TO SEE
