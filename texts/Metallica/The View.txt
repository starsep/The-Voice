I have no morals
Some think me cheap
And someone who despises
The normalcy of heartbreak
The purity of love

But I worship the young
And just formed angel

Who sits upon the pin of lust
Everything else
Bores me

I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up
Your life of reason
I want you on the floor
And in a coffin your soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune

Oh throw it away

For worship someone
Who actively despises you

For worship someone
Who actively despises you

I am the root
I am the progress
I'm the aggressor
I am the tablet
These ten stories
