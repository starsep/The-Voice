Saint Anger 'round my neck
Saint Anger 'round my neck
He never gets respect
Saint Anger 'round my neck
(You flush it out, you flush it out)
Saint Anger 'round my neck
(You flush it out, you flush it out)
He never gets respect
(You flush it out, you flush it out)
Saint Anger 'round my neck
(You flush it out, you flush it out)
He never gets respect

Fuck it all and no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
I need a voice to let myself
To let myself go free
Fuck it all and fuckin' no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
Medallion noose, I hang myself
Saint Anger 'round my neck

I feel my world shake
Like an earth quake
It's hard to see clear
Is it me? Is it fear?
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you


(repeat all)

I want my anger to be healthy
I want my anger just for me
I need my anger not to control
I want my anger to be me
I need to set my anger free
I need to set my anger free
I need to set my anger free
I need to set my anger free

Fuck it all and no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
Tie a noose or hang myself
Saint Anger 'round my neck

I feel my world shake
Like an earth quake
It's hard to see clear
Is it me? Is it fear?
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
