You rise, you fall, you crash, then you're up again
What don't kill you make you more strong
You rise, you fall, you crash, then you're up again
What don't kill you make you more strong

Rise, fall, crash, rise again
What don't kill you make you more strong
Rise, fall, crash, rise again
What don't kill you make you more strong

Yeah yeah

Let the skies tell the story
Pay your dues
Let the skies tell the story
Born to lose
Let the skies tell the story
Before I die
Let the skies tell the story
Cause dark never lie

The crown, the crawl, the birth, and the end it all
Dying's easy it's living that's hard
The crown, the crawl, the birth, and the end it all
Dying's easy it's living that's hard

Crown, crawl, birth, end it all
Dying's easy it's living that's hard
Crown, crawl, birth, end it all
Dying's easy it's living that's hard

Yeah yeah
Oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah

Let the skies tell the story
Pay your dues
Let the skies tell the story
Born to lose
Let the skies tell the story
They insist
Let the skies tell the story
Cause they tell it best

[Solo]

Let the skies tell the story
Pay your dues
Let the skies tell the story
Born to lose
Let the skies tell the story
They insist
Let the skies tell the story
Cause they tell it best

Let the skies tell the story
Pay your dues
Let the skies tell the story
Born to lose
Let the skies tell the story
They insist
Let the skies tell the story
Cause they tell it best
