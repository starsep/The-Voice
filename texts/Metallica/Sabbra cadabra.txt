Feel so good I feel so fine
Love that little lady always on my mind
She gives me lovin' every night and day
Never gonna leave her
Never going away
Someone to love me
You know she makes me feel alright
Someone who needs me
Love me every single night
Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love
It's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman till the end of time
Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time
She make me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine
I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime
I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceived
You gotta believe me
I'm talking to you
Well I know its hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
More when it's time to die
Don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on
Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love
It's something out of this world
Feles so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman till the end of time
Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time
She make me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine
She's all mine
