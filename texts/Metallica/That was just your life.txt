Like a siren in my head that i was placed to repeat,
Like a blind man that was shoved into the speeding driver's seat,
Like a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to fight,
Like a misery that keeps me from just going out astray,
Like an illness that i'm about to waken from its state.

Contradiction,
A premonition,
Now are the aids who i deny,
I deny.

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place,
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace.
I blind my eyes, i hardly feel it passing me by,
I open just in time to say goodbye.

Almost like your life,
Almost like your endless fight,
Cursed, the day is long,
Realize you don't belong,
Disconnect somehow,
Never stop complaining now,
Almost like your fight,
And there it went,
Almost like your life.

[Solo]

Like a bullet, keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think,
Like a raging river, drowning when i only need a drink,
Like a poison that i swallow, but i want the world to die.

Like a release from a prison that i didn't know i was in,
Like a fight to live the present, i pictured it like this,
Like a general without a mission until the wars start again,
Start again.

I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place,
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace.
I blind my eyes, i hardly feel it passing me by,
I open just in time to say goodbye.

Almost like your life,
Almost like your endless fight,
Cursed, the day is long,
Realize you don't belong,
Disconnect somehow,
Never stop complaining now,
Almost like your fight,
And there it went,
Almost like your life.

Like a touch from hell,
I feel how hot that it can get if you get caught,
Like a strike from heaven that turns that key,
That brings you straight down to your knees,
Like a touch from hell,
I feel how hot that it can get if i get caught,
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve,
That brings you straight down to your knees.

Almost like your life,
Almost like your endless fight,
Cursed, the day is long,
Realize you don't belong,
Disconnect somehow,
Never stop complaining now,
Almost like your fight,
And there it went,
Almost like your life.
That was just your life.
