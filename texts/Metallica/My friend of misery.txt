You just stood there screaming

fearing no one was listening to you

they say the empty can rattles the most

The sound of your own voice must smoothe you

hearing only what you want to hear

and knowing only what you've heard

You you're smothered in tragedy

you're out to save the world

Misery

you insist that the weight of the world

should be on your shoulders

Misery

there's much more to life than what you see

My friend of misery

You still stood there screaming

No one caring about these words you tell

my friend before your voice is gone

One man's fun is another's hell

these time are sent to try men's souls

but something's wrong with all you see

Yoy you'll take it on all yourself

remember, misery loves company

Misery

you insist that weight of the world

should be on your shoulders

Misery

there's much more to life than what you see

My friend of misery

You just stood there screaming

My friend of misery
