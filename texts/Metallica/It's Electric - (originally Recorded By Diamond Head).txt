I'm gonna be a rock and roll star
Gotta blow my crummy job
Gotta groove from night to day
Gonna blow my blues away
Gonna make a million
I'm gonna make a stand
I'm gonna be wild my friend
Gonna make it with you
I gotta push it through

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
I stop on red and I leave on amber

I'm gonna make it my friend
And you face my way
Gonna get the tilts from my hills
Gonna make it today
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my route
Make it in a rock and roll show

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
And you face my way

I stop on red and I leave on amber
Gonna make it today
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna get the tilts from my hills
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my route
Make it in a rock and roll show

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
