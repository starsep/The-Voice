Little boy you're going to hell
You said bad words
Threw rocks at the birds
And now this is your hotel
You ain't going back
This ain't Disneyland it's hell
Little boy it's time for you to pay
For hurtin' that bird
And not going to church
And staring at boobs everyday
Thought you were in bed
Instead you're in hell
Hell isn't good
Hell isn't good
Hell
Oh Hell isn't good
Hell isn't good
Hell
Hell isn't good
Hell isn't good
Hell
