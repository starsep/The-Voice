There is nowhere else I can run to
She is wretched but she comforts me
After everyone goes home
She's always there for me
And when the sun goes hellbound
And the moon does resurrect the night
I'll hide within her
Not much good has come out of the light

After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
Straight down, yeah

A lonely light in a window
Just longing for some company
Tragic, heartless and hateful
But there's nothing as willing as she
And when the night has fallen
It falls hard and then it all begins
When she starts her calling
I feel my darkness growing from within

After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
I will run straight to Hell and back

I become two, we become one
Unbridled... unequaled... unholy... undone

The path is cut deep, the path is worn well
I'll follow my footsteps to the warmth of Hell
The warmth of Hell

After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and back
Down to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
I will run straight to Hell and back, yeah!

Straight down!
