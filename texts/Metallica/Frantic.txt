If I could have my wasted days back
I'd use them to get back on track
Tried to warn
Karma's burning
Look ahead but keep on turning

Do I have the strength, or do I let go?
Can I find it inside to do what I should have known?
Can I have my wasted days back?
I'd use them to get back on track

You live it or lie it
You live it or lie it
You live it or lie it
You live it or lie it

My lifestyle determines my deathstyle

I want out of always being afraid
In this stream of fear that I've made
Treading water full of worry
Frantic-tic-tic-tic-toc of hurry

Do I have the strength, or do I let go?
Can I find it inside to do what I should have known?
Can I have out of always being afraid?
