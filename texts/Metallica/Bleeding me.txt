I'm diggin' my way
I'm diggin' my way to something
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better

I'm pushin' my stay
I'm pushin' my stay to something
I'm pushin' my stay to something better

I'm sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted

This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted

It tears me and I bleed

***Caught under wheels roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me I can' ttake it
Caught under wheel's roll
The bleeding of me

*** Repeat

I am the beast that feeds the beast
I am the blood, I am the release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught under

*** Repeat

* Repeat

** Repeat
