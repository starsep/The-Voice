We are scanning the scene in the city tonight
We are looking for you to start up a fight
There is an evil feeling in our brains
But it is nothing new you know it drives us insane

Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Running
On our way
Hdiing
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy

There is no escape
And that is for sure
This is the end we won't take any more
Say goodbye
To the world you live in
You have always been taking
But now your giving

Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy

Our brains are on fire
With the feeling to kill
And it will not go away
Until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing
On our minds
Don't try running away
Cause you're the one we will find

Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
