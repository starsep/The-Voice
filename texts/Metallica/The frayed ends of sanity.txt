Never Hunger
Never Prosper
I Have Fallen Prey to Failure
Struggle Within
Triggered Again
Now the Candle Burns at Both Ends

Twisting under Schizophrenia
Falling Deep into Dementia

Old Habits Reappear
Fighting the Fear of Fear
Growing Conspiracy
Everyone's after Me
Frayed Ends of Sanity
Hear Them Calling
Hear Them Calling Me

Birth of Terror
Death of Much More
I'm the Slave of Fear,my Captor
Never Warnings
Spreading its Wings
As I Wait for the Horror She Brings
Loss of Interest,question,wonder
Waves of Fear They Pull Me under

Old Habits Reappear
Fighting the Fear of Fear
Growing Conspiracy
Everyone's after Me
Frayed Ends of Sanity
Hear Them Calling
Hear Them Calling Me

Into Run
I Am Sinking
Hostage of this Nameless Feeling
Hell Is Set Free
Flooded I'll Be
Feel the Underto wInside Me

Height,hell,time,haste,terror,tension
Life,death,want,waste,mass Depression

Old Habbits Reappear
Fighting the Fear of Fear
Growing Conspiracy
Myself Is after Me
Frayed Ends of Sanity
Hear Them Calling
Frayed Ends of Sanity
Hear Them Calling
Hear Them Calling Me
