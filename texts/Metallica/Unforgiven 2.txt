Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I want to hear
To make my demons run

The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me
Then, I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night
We share this paralyze

The door cracks open
But there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still

But there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn to stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

Yeah!

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there?
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?

Come lay beside me
This won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still
But she'll never love again

She lay beside me
But she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still

Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there...

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn to stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

Yeah!

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there?
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?

(Solo)

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed
So are your eyes

But now I see the sun
Now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it!

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn to stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

Yeah!

What I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired I stand alone
Could you be there?
'Cause I'm the one who waits...
The one who waits for you, oh!

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn to stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you? (So I dub thee unforgiven)
Oh!

What I've felt, oh, what I've known
I take this key
And I bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven, too.

Never be, never me

'Cause you're unforgiven, too.

Oh, ho, whoa, oh...
