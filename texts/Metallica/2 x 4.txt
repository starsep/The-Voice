I'm gonna make
you, shake you, take you
I'm gonna be the one who breaks you
Put the screws to ya my way
Yeah, come on come on, come, make my day

Got some hell at pay, I steal your thunder
The joy of violent movements pulls you under
Bite the bullet well hard
Yeah, but I die harder, so go too far

Friction, fusion
Retribution
I can't hear ya talk ta me
I can't hear ya so talk ta me
I can't here ya are you talkin' ta me
I can't year ya are you talkin' ta me
I can't hear ya time ta meet my lord
I can't hear ya talk ta 2x4

I'm gonna make you, shake you, take you
I'mg gonna be the one who breaks you
Put the screws to ya my way
Yeah, come on come on, come, make my da

Friction, fusion
Retribution
I can't hear ya talk ta me
I can't hear ya so talk ta me
I can't here ya are you talkin' ta me
I can't year ya are you talkin' ta me
I can't hear ya time ta meet my lord
I can't hear ya talk ta 2x4
