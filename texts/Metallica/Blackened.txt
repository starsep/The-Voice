Blackened Is the End
Winter it Will Send
Throwing All You See
Into Obscurity

Death of Mother Earth
Never a Rebirth
Evolution's End
Never Will it Mend

Never

Fire
To Begin Whipping Dance of the Dead
Blackened Is the End
To Begin Whipping Dance of the Dead
Color Our World Blackened

Bustering of Earth
Terminate its Worth
Deadly Nicotine
Kills What Might Have Been

Callous Frigid Chill
Nothing Left to Kill
Never Seen Before
Breathing Nevermore

Never

Fire
To Begin Whipping Dance of the Dead
Blackened Is the End
To Begin Whipping Dance of the Dead
Color Our World Blackened

Blackened

Opposition...Contradiction...Premonition...Compromise
Agitation...Violation...Mutilation...Planet Dies
Darkest Color
Blistered Earth
True Death of Life
Termination....Expiration...Cancellation...Human Race
Expectation...Liberation...Population...Lay to Waste
See Our Mother
Put to Death
See Our Mother Die

Smouldering Decay
Take Her Breath Away
Millions of Our Years
In Minutes Disappears

Darkening in Vain
Decadence Remains
All Is Said and Done
Never Is the Sun

Never

Fire
To Begin Whipping Dance of the Dead
Blackened Is the End
To Begin Whipping Dance of the Dead
Fire
Is the Outcome of Hypocrisy
Darkest Potency
In the Exit of Humanity
Color Our World Blackened

Blackened
