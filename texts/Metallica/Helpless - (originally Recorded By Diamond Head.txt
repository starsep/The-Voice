I've gotta see you moving fast, see you come my way.
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away.
Gotta see the lights above, make it loud tonight.

Gotta set it all afire, set it all alight.
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta fill this hall tonight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,

Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.

I don't know what I'm gonna do, maybe not tonight.
Gotta set you all afire, gotta treat you right.
I can see the flashing lights, lit before your love.
Gotta hear the thunder roar, coming from above.
I am gonna set you all alight.
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,

Gotta fill this hall tonight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,


I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.


Cannot squeeze the life from me.
I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.

Cannot squeeze the life from me
