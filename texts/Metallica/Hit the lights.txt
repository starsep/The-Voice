No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
when our fans start screaming
Its right, well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

You know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow thi splace away
With volume higher
Than anything today, the only way
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

With all out screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain, oh sweet pain
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
