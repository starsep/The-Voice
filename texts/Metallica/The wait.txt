Motives changing, 
Day to day 
The fire increases 
masks decay 
I look at the river 
white foam floats down 
The body´s poisoned 
Got to sit tight 

The wait____________ 
The wait____________ 
The wait____________ 
The wait____________ 

After awakeing 
The silence grows 
The screams subside 
distortion shows 
Mutant thoughts 
Of badmouthed news 
It´s just another birth 
Of distorted views 


The wait____________ 
The wait____________ 
The wait____________ 
The wait____________
