Look inside and you will see 
The words are cutting deep inside my brain 
Thunder burnin' quickly burning 
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah 

Raven black is on my track 
He shows me how to neutralize the knife 
Show to me in surgery 
The art of fighting words to conquer life, conquer life yeah 

Now the wicked lance of fear 
Is driven from my heady mountain brain 
Crash course in brain surgery 
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again yeah, yeah, yeah

I got something to say 
I killed your baby today 
And it doesn't matter much to me 
As long as it's dead 

I got something to say 
I raped your mother today 
And it doesn't matter much to me 
As long as she's spread 

Sweet lovely death 
I am waiting for your breath 
Come sweet death, one last caress 

Sweet lovely death 
I am waiting for your breath 
Come sweet death, one last caress 

Well, I got something to say 
I killed your baby today 
And it doesn't matter much to me 
As long as it's dead 

Sweet lovely death 
I am waiting for your breath 
Come sweet death 
One last caress 


Here in this place lies the genie of death 
Touch it, see it 
Whoa 

Here in this place is a means to your end 
Touch it, feel it 
Green hell 

You've come to this like no one could 
I bet you never knew you woke it 
And don't you run away from anything 
I bet you thought you really could in Hell 

We're gonna burn in Hell 
Green hell 
Like every hell but kind of green 
In Hell, green hell 
We're gonna face the mess we're 
In Hell, green hell 
I think I'd rather be up here 
In Hell, green hell 
You know I fuckin' shake apart 
In Hell, green hell 
Gotta find a way that you will stay 
Green hell 
Cannot forget about the heat 
In Hell, green hell 
Hell is green I need a flame 
In Hell, green hell 
Gonna burn in Hell 
Green hell 

You've come to this like no one could 
I bet you never knew you woke it 
And don't you run from anything 
I bet you thought you really could take it 

Here in this place is the genie of death 
Touch it, see it 
Whoa 
Here in this place is the way to your end 
Touch it, see it 
Green hell 

You've come to this like no one could 
I bet you never knew you woke it 
And don't you run away from anything 
I bet you thought you really could 
You've come to this like no one could 
I bet you never knew you woke it 
We're gonna burn in Hell 
Green hell
