 Need
More and more 
Tainted misery 

Bleed
Battle scars 
Chemical affinity 

Reign
Legacy 
Innocence corrode 

Stain 
Rot away 
Catatonic overload 

Choke 
Asphyxia 
Snuff reality 

Scorch 
Kill the light 
Incinerate celebrity 

Reaper 
Butchery 
Karma amputee 

Bloodline 
Redefine
Death contagious deity 

Hooked into this deceiver 
Need more and more
Into the endless fever 
Need more and more 

New consequence machine 
Burn through all your gasoline 
Asylum overtime 
Nevermind
You`ve reached the end of the line 

Time 
Choke the clock 
Steal another day 

Die 
Faithfully 
Narcissistic fade away 

Twisted 
Jump the rail 
Shatter the crowd below 

Breaker 
Chase the ghost 
From latest high to alltime low 

Hooked into this deceiver 
Need more and more 
Into the endless fever 
Need more and more

New consequence machine 
Burn through all your gasoline 
Asylum overtime 
Nevermind
You`ve reached the end of the line 

Drop the hourglass of time 
Spilling sand we will not find 
As we gather here today 
We bid farewell... 
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master 
The slave becomes the master, yeah! 

The slave becomes the master 
Need more and more 
Right now and everafter 
Need more and more 

New consequence machine 
Burn through all your gasoline 
Asylum overtime 
Nevermind 
Dead hourglass of time 
The sand we will not ever find 
We gather here today 
Say goodbye
Cause you've reached the end of the line! 

The end of the line 
The end of the line 
The end of the line 
You've reached the end of the line...
