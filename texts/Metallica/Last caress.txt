I've got something to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

I've got something to say
I raped your mother today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as she's spread

Sweet lovely death
I am waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress

Sweet lovely death
I am waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one lastc aress

Well, I've got something to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

Sweet lovely death
I am waiting for your breath
Come sweet death
One last caress
