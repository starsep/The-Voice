Man in black comes around
Blacks the light
Blacks the sound
Fear the thought of it never ever coming back
Leave the shift to the round


Open up your gate
Spirit dialate
Watch the falling sand
Shifting through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dialate
Whisper To Your Friends
Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
Its the beginning
It's aâ€¦

Paid my dues in the cell
Be the toll of the bell
Dearly beloved
We gathered here today
To say goodbye to our old selves

Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dialate
Watch the falling sand
Slipping through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dialate
Go tell all Your Friends
Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
Its the begining

Ive been a rambler, the light changes me
Ive been a rambler, the light sets me free

Sets me free

*Guitar Solo*

Yeah!

Ive been a rambler the light sets me free
Ive been a gambler the light sets me free

Sets me free

Haha!

Man in black comes around
Blacks the light
Blacks the sound
Dearly beloved
We gathered here today
To say goodbye to our old selves

Open up your gate
Spirit dialate
Watch the falling sand
Slipping through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dialate
Go Tell all Your Friend
Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
Its the begining

Death is not the end!
