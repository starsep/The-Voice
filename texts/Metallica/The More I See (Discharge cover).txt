From where I stand I see 
Pain, suffering and misery - Hey, ah 

The more I see (The more I see) , 
The less, the less I believe 

From where I stand I see 
Hate, violence and war 

The more I see (The more I see) , 
The less, the less I believe 

The more I see (The more I see) , 
Ah, the less, the less I believe 

From where I stand I see 
Pain, suffering and misery - Hey, ah 

The more I see (The more I see) , 
The less, the less I belie_________________ve 

The more I see 
The more I see 
The more I see 
The more I see 
The more I see 
The less, the less I believe 

(Thank you!)
