Sleep, and dream of this
Death angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely

Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay?
Empty, they say
Death, hear me call your name?
Ooo, call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Wait, wait patiently
Your death black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me

Empty, they say
Death, won't you let me stay?
Empty, they say
Death, hear me call your name?
Ooo, call your name
Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Say, is that rain or are they tears?
That stained your concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
The concrete angel lit right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
Its peace at last
Oh, peace at last

Empty, they say
Death, won't you let me stay?
Empty, they say
Death, hear me call your name?
Call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, livng dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
