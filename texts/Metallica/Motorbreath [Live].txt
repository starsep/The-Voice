Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane, just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy dirty and mean, yeah

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away, c'mon

Don't stop for nothing, full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks, shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way, ha
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away, Paris


what life is about
You only live once, take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, the same fuckin' dance, yeah

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way, no
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away, motherfucker, yeah
