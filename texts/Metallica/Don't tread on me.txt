Don't tread on me
Say don't tread on me

Libery or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged...
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage

Say don't tread on me

So be it
threaten no more
to secure peace is to prepere for war
So be it
settle the score
touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...

Don't tread on me

Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as the lightning strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance

Say don't tread on me

So be it
threaten no more
to secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
settle the score
touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...

Don't tread on me

So be it
threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
Liberity or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling on her tail
So be it
threaten no more
to secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
settle the score
touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...

Don't tread on me
