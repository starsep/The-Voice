Don't make fun
We've just begun
Let's not play...
Just for today
Take it slow
You have to go
I think we're through...I'm still not ready for good times
Don't ask me why...
Never try laughter before sorrow...
Across the room
Let's not assume
We can forgive
The way of it
It's getting cold out...
so please close the open door and all the windows of my soul
