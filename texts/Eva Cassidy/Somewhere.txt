Is time my redeemer?
Loneliness my only friend?
Just once in a lifetime
Strangers share a common end
And I like an arrow
Straight for love I went again
And you like tomorrow
Never knowing where an when.

Somewhere, somehow
At sometime someone cared
Maybe just for a moment
Or maybe for a lifetime
Are the threads that bind us together
Falling loose or growing stronger?
Look at it now, look at the picture
Has it changed or is it still the same?

Hear, hear, hear, hear...
