In the twilight glow I see
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Someday soon we'll meet up yonder
And we'll walk hand in hand again
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
