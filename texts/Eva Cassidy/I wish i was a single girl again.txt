When I was single I went dressed up so fine 
now I am married long and I go ragged all the time 
ooh lord, don't I wish I was a single girl again 

I got dishes to wash 
springs to go to 
when you are married long enough 
you got it all to do 
ooh lord, don't I wish I was a single girl again 

yeah, ooh lord don't I wish I was a single girl again 
ooh lord, don't I wish I was a single girl again
