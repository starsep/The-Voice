I hear the drizzle on the way 
Like a memory it falls 
Soft and warm continuing 
Tapping on my roof and walls 

My mind's distracted and confused 
My thoughts are many miles away 
They lie with you in your sleep 
And kiss you when you start your day 

And as I watch the drops of rain 
Weave their weary paths and die 
I know that I am like the rain 
There but for the grace of you go I
