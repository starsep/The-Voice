For you 
There'll be no crying 
For you 
The Sun will be shining 

Refrain: 
Cause I feel that when I'm with you 
It's alright 
I know it's right 
And the Songbirds keep singing up there 
Know the Score 
And I love you I love you I love you like never before 

To you 
I would give the World 
To you 
I'll never be cold 

Refrain
