Blue skies smiling on me 
Nothing but blue skies do I see 
Blue birds singing a song 
Nothing but blue skies from now on. 

I never saw the sun shining so bright 
When you’re in love everything’s right 
Watching all the days hurrying by 
When you’re in love my how they fly 

Those blue days all of them gone 
And nothing but blue sky from now on
