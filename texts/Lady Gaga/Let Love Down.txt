cant remember when he looked at me and cried
Said something broke inside of you
Youre my best friend
Whatever come our way
You know im your gal till the e-e-end

(bridge)
When i finally go away
I know youll look for me one day
(chorus)
When you let love down
Oh you let love down
I dont have to remind you
But you know that im around
When you let love down
Oh you let me down
Get a little love down
Let it down oh oh

I cant remember when
You put your hands on mine
But couldnt play in time when we
were not together
Just sing a little song
Blueberry kisses foreve-e-er

(Bridge)
Oh yeah its so sad
(Chorus)
Ohhh ohhh
Dont let me down
Ohh dont let me down
Ohhh ohh
(Chorus)
