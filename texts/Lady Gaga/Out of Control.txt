Hey babe,
I'm feelin' somethin' kinda crazy
I know that we got somethin' special, boy
But lately I've been feelin' naughtier
Than usual

(You see I)
Need a love that's crazy, don't you see?
I'm looking for someone that can handle me
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so
I'm sorry when I mention that, I did not know
You and me were kind of incomplete
Need someone to say they love me

Give it up
Put it up
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
I need it
Out of control

Give it up, just let your body
Out of control,
Give it up, just let your body
Out of control,
Give it up, just let your body
Out of control,
Give it up, just let your body
Out of control,
Give it up, just let your body
Out of control,
Give it up, just let your body
Out of control,
Give it up, just let your body
Out of control,
Give it up, just let your body
Out of control,
