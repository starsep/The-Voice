I want your whiskey mouth 
All over my blonde south 
Red wine and cheap perfume 
And a filthy shout 

Tonight bring all your friends 
Because a group does it better 
Why river with a pair 
Let's have a full house of leather 

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who 
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who 
Heavy metal lover 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who 
Who-who-who ooh-who-who 
Who who 
Heavy metal lover 

Dirty pony I can't wait to hose you down 
You've got to earn your leather in this part of town 

Dirty pearls and a patch for all the Rivington Rebels 
Let's raise hell in the streets, drink beer and get into trouble 

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who 
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who 
Heavy metal lover 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who 
Who-who-who ooh-who-who 
Who who 
Heavy metal lover 

I could be your girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But would you love me if I ruled the world, world, world?

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who 
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who 
Heavy metal lover 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who 
Who-who-who ooh-who-who 
Who who 
Heavy metal lover 

Whip me, slap me, punk funk 
New York clubbers, bump, drunk
Bud Light, liquors, bar, slam
Move it, this is your jam
Wash the night with St. J-ameson
Like a baptism
Heavy metal lovers play
Because we were born this way

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who 
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who 

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who 
Who-who-who ooh-who-who 
Who who 

Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who 
Who-who-who ooh-who-who
Who who 
Heavy metal lover 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-who-who 
Who-who-who ooh-who-who 
Who who 
Heavy metal lover 

I could be your girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But would you love me if I ruled the world, world, world?
