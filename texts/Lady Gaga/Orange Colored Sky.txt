I was walking along, minding my business,
When out of the orange colored sky,
Flash, bam, alacazam, Wonderful you came by.

I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine,
When out of that orange colored view
Wham, bam, alacazam, I got a look at you.

One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass.
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit, This is it, this is it, this is it.

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, bam, alacazam,
Out of the orange colored sky

(Lady GaGa Added Lyrics)
She was walking along minding her business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash, bam, alacazm,
A handsome prince came by
Kate was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that cool Saint Andrews View
Wam, bam, alacazm
She got a look at you

Ohhh,
One look and he yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass
Cause the ceiling fell in and the chapel
Oh, the west minister Abby was covered enough
He was hit, she was hit, they were Hitched!

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wam, bam, alacazam,
Out of the orange colored, purple striped, pretty green polka dot skyyy
Flash, bam, alacazaaam,
Had gooonnne, to kate and well, by.
