Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my prose and lipstick on so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
Laying down on famous knives so everybody sees

Bleach out all all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself
Maybe I'll just clean the shit of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you

I wish that I was strong
I was that I was wrong-ooong-ooong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note
ooooh- ooooh

I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been trying to tell you how I feel
But was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
I'll do it in the swimming pool
So everybody sees

Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Volumes I know will love and save me from myself

Maybe I'll just keep clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you

Princess die: I want to see her cry
Princess die-eyeee
Princess die: We want to watch her cry
Princess die-eyeee

I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong-oooong-ooong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note-oooh-oooh
I wish that I could go
in my rich boyfriend's limo

Right after he proposed
with a 16 carat stone wrapped in rose gold

With the Paparazzi all swarming around
In my Louis Vuiton White buttoned down
Oh it's not that deep

So bob your head for another dead blonde
Who's real prince is in heaven
She just wants to sleep

The final act of life will be my own hands to do,
I'll be a Princess and die with you
