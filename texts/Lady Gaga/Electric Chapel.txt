My body is sanctuary 
My blood is pure 
Doot doo doo 
Doot doot doo doo 
You want me bad 
I think you're cool 
But I'm not sure 
Doot doo doo 
Doot doot doo doo 

Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something more from you 
It's not about sex or champagne you holy fool 
Doot doo doo 
Doot doot doo doo 

If you want me meet me at electric chapel 
If you want me meet me at electric chapel 
If you want to steal my heart away 
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place 
Come on meet me 
In electric chapel 

Confess to me 
Where you have been 
Next to the bar 
Doot doo doo 
Doot doot doo doo 
Pray for your sins 
Right under the glass disco ball 
Doot doo doo 
Doot doot doo doo 

Follow me, don't be such a holy fool 
Follow me, I need something sacred from you
Together we'll both find a way
To make a pure love work in dirty way

If you want me meet me at electric chapel 
If you want me meet me at electric chapel 
If you want to steal my heart away 
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place 
Come on meet me 
In electric chapel 

Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me

If you want me meet me at electric chapel 
If you want me meet me at electric chapel 
If you want to steal my heart away 
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place 
Come on meet me 
In electric chapel 

Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
