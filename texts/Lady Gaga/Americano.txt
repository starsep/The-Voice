I met a girl in east LA 
In floral shorts as sweet as May 
She sang in eights in two Barrio chords 
We fell in love 
But not in court 

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Ahhhhh-americaaaa Americanoooo 
Ahhhhh-americaaaa Americanoooo 

Mis canciones son de la revolucion 
Mi coraz칩n me duele por mi generati칩n 
If you love me
We can marry 
On the west coast 
On a Wednesday 
En un verano 
En agosto 

I don't speak your
I don't speak your 
Languagono 
I don't speak your 
I won't speak your 
Jesus Christo 

Ahhhhh-americaaaa Americanoooo 
Ahhhhh-americaaaa Americanoooo 

I will fight for 
I have fought for 
How I love you 
I have cried for 
I will die for 
How I care
In the mountains
Las campanas
Est치n sonando 
Todos los chicos (chicas) 
Y los chicos (chicas) est치n besando

I don't speak your
I don't speak your 
Languagono 
I don't speak your 
I won't speak your 
Jesus Christo 

I don't speak your 
I don't speak your
Americano 
I don't speak your
I won't speak your 
Jesus Christo 

Ahhhhh-americaaaa Americanoooo 
Ahhhhh-americaaaa Americanoooo 
Ahhhhh-americaaaa Americanoooo 
Ahhhhh-americaaaa Americanoooo 

Don't you try to catch me 
Don't you try to catch me 
No, no, no, no 
I'm living on the edge of
Living on the edge of the 
Law, law, law, law 
Don't you try to catch me 
Don't you try to get me 
No, no, no, no 
Don't you try to catch me 
I'm living on the edge of the 
Law, law, law, law
