Hello, hello, baby
You called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you see, see
Wha-wha-what did you say?
Oh, you're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you,
I'm kinda busy

K-kinda busy
K-kinda busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

Just a second,
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with
A drink in my hand, eh
You shoulda made some plans with me,
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kinda busy

Stop callin', stop callin',
I don't wanna think anymore!
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin',
I don't wanna talk anymore!
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Can call all you want,
But there's no one home,
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!
Out in the club,
And I'm sippin' that bub,
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!

Call when you want,
But there's no one home,
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!
Out in the club,
And I'm sippin' that bub,
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!

Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster,
Leave my girls no faster
I shoulda left my phone at home,
'Cause this is a disaster!
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer!

Not that I don't like you,
I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired
Of my phone r-ringing.
Sometimes I feel like
I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls,
'Cause I'll be dancin'

'Cause I'll be dancin'
'Cause I'll be dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'!

Stop callin', stop callin',
I don't wanna think anymore!
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin',
I don't wanna talk anymore!
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop callin', stop callin',
I don't wanna think anymore!
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin',
I don't wanna talk anymore!
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Can call all you want,
But there's no one home,
You're not gonna reach my telephone!
'Cause I'm out in the club,
And I'm sippin' that bub,
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!

Call when you want,
But there's no one home,
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!
'Cause I'm out in the club,
And I'm sippin' that bub,
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!

My telephone!
M-m-my telephone!
'Cause I'm out in the club,
And I'm sippin' that bub,
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!

My telephone!
M-m-my telephone!
'Cause I'm out in the club,
And I'm sippin' that bub,
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!
