Last time, I thought we had this talk
Boy, you were getting ready to leave
I thought that baby you were done
Cause for a while, you could barely look at me

This time, I thought that wed be fine
That Id forget the thing that you said
I tried crossing out your words
But baby, you can not forget the past
Can not forget the past
Still, baby.

Im so unbreakable, you dont know what to think
So unemotional, wonder if Im still in love
You see, I dont know what to tell you now
Its always harder the second time around
Im so unbreakable, just like you used to be
So unemotional, boy I cant forget the way you were with me
I dont know what to tell you know
Its always harder the second time around

The second time around

We tried going back to Joes
That was always our favorite place
Long rides, baby by the coast
Do you remember where we stayed?
Last time, we were hanging out
You were acting kind of strange
Now its the second time around
Im starting to see, its me that feels this way
(My heart just speaks to me)
Its me that feels this way
I know that you are the one that is brave

Im not sure the best way to say this
But I cant pretend to love you no more, babe
This Ferris wheels got me crazy
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us, baby
Not meant for us, baby
The second time around
