I'm not bad,
I just sound that way

All the girls they like their presents, like their presents
When boys wrap 'em up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons,
Doesn't matter if they're precious or expensive if they're
Well thought out, sexed up, wrapped right
Every time, get in line and give me mine

We like black, white,
Big striped,
Polka-dotted
Cafe latte
Presents come in many sizes
Wrap them up in ribbons

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up

I'm not a Hallmark card expression
Need material attention
Wrapped in ribbons
Richard Simmons, silly ribbons, ribbons, ribbons

If you can't afford the best
Don't be stressed, take a rest
Get a job, do it right
It's my birthday all night

We like black, white,
Big striped, famous supersizing
We don't care what you put inside it,
Wrap it up in ribbons

It's the life style that I like
I'll give you yours,
You'll give me mine,
But don't forget to wrap them up in pretty, pretty ribbons

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up

Only difference between downtown and uptown is
Therapy and valium, therapy and valium
Not lying when I say this, there's a price to being famous
Yeah, it's therapy and valium, therapy and valium, huh!

It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up, everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up (wrap it up now), everybody wrap it up

(Lots of presents)
It's not complicated
(Filthy riches)
Just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up (wrap it up now), everybody wrap it up

(Got good presents)
It's not complicated
(Filthy riches)
Just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up (wrap it up now), everybody wrap it up

Wrap it up now

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons

Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up

(Wrap)
Wrap them presents up
