There he goes
My baby walks so slow
Sexual tic-tac-toe
Yeah, I know we both know
It isn’t time
But would you be mine?

We'll never get too far
Just you, me and the...
in a ménage à trois sometimes
Would he be mine?
Would he be mine?
Would you be mine?

Oh baby, lights on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever yeah

There it goes
You stole my soul and so
'Cause, sweetheart
A-no-no-nobody a-no-no-knows
They're occupied
Tell me you'll be mine

Let's get inside your car
Just you, me and the stars
Kind of ménage à trois
Sometimes

Would he be mine?
Would he be mine?
Could you be mine?

Oh baby, lights on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Oh baby, your light's on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever yeah

Fever, fever, yeah
