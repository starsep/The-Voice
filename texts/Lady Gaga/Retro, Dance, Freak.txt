Hello, Everybody,

Get her out to the west side,

Kiss the girl with her tongue tied,

Hello, Everybody,

Work it out,

'Cause you don't care,

Shut down like software,

Hello, Everybody,

Take a sip for the hip-hop,

Fuel up at the next stop,

We're just physical,

Creatures of the underworld,

She is the queen of the full disco scene



Retro, Dance, Freak,

Singin' retro dance beats,

Retro, Daaance, Freak,

Undercover,

Girl needs a lover



What's up, Everybody,

Take a ride on an airplane,

Take a bath in champagne,

What's up, Everybody,

Watch the girls all curtsy,

For the paparazzi,

Let's go, Everybody,

It's time that we rotate,

'Cause it's gettin' real late,

We're just physical,

Creatures of the underworld,

She is the queen of the full disco scene



Retro, Dance, Freak,

Singin' retro dance beats,

Retro, Dance, Freak,

Undercover,

Girl needs a lover,

Retro, Dance, Freak,

Singin' retro dance beats,

Retro, Daaance, Freak,

Undercover,

Girl needs a lover,



Retro, Dance, Freak,

Singin' retro dance beats,

Retro, Daaance, Freak,

Undercover,

Oh, The girl,

She needs a lover,

We are cursed,

Physical creatures of the underworld,

She is the queen of the full disco scene,



Retro, Dance, Freak,

Singin' retro dance beats,

Retro, Daaance, Freak,

Undercover,

Girl needs a lover,

Retro, Dance, Freak,

Singin' retro dance beats
