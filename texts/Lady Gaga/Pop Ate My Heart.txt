- Where is it? Where is it, Candy? Candy?
- He ate it
- Yes, I don't believe you
- Look for yourself... pop ate my heart
- I see
- He downed the whole thing... in one efficient gulp... like a beautiful monster... then took off into the city
- Oh, Candy
- And now I just feel... I feel so...
- Empty?
- No... No...
- Candy?
- Free... I feel free

Huhh...
I need mmmmore... to feed my pop heart
Give me more
I want
The future, Gaga, fashion, digital technology, dance, New York, music, pop culture
I want... the fame
I can hear you
Can you hear me?
Revolution is coming
And I want... what we want
You deserve... the future

My name is Lady Gaga
And this is my haus!
