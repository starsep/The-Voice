I never ever thought I'd live away
from everyone I love and say goodbye
now I'm the princess of a downtown train
where everybody here, they know my game
but when I walk down the street I hear them say
"there she goes, that crazy girl
she thinks she's something in this world"

So I'mma close my ears and dream
'cause life is never really what it seems
in every mystery, there's a truth
you know I'm tellin', I'm tellin' you-

no matter lightning or thunder,
buckets of rainwater
you can't flood this town

in a world unknown
you've gotta hold your own
you can't stop me-
you're never ever gonna stop me now

On every street there is a memory,
a time and place where we can never be again
street lights glow green, red, and yellow too
do you let signs tell you what to do?
Yeah, when you say stop,
be sure that I'll say go
to the stars in the land

fire can't burn these hands
but I just close my eyes and dream
you cant deny me my astronomy

in every mystery, there's a truth
you know I'm tellin', I'm tellin' you-

no matter lightning or thunder,
buckets of rainwater
you can't flood this town

in a world unknown
you've gotta hold your own
and you can't stop me-
you're never ever ever gonna stop me now

go ahead and don't believe
'cause everyone needs a way to dream
and love and you can't stop me
no you can't stop me

no matter lightning or thunder,
buckets of rainwater
you can't flood this town

in a world unknown
you've gotta hold your own
and you can't stop me-
you're never ever ever gonna stop me-

no matter lightning or thunder,
buckets of rainwater
you can't flood this town

in a world unknown
you've gotta hold your own
