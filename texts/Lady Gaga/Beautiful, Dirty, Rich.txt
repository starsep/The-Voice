We got a redlight
Pornographic dance fight
Systematic, honey

Our hair is perfect
While were all getting shit wrecked
It's automatic, honey
But we got no money

We just like to party, like to p-p-party yeah

Bang bang, we're beautiful and dirty rich
Bang bang, we're beautiful and dirty rich

We live a cute life
Sound fanatic, pants tight
Pants tighter than plastic, honey
But we got no money

We do the dance right
We got it made like
Ice cream topped with honey
But we got no money

Daddy I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry yeah
We just like to party, like to p-p-party yeah
