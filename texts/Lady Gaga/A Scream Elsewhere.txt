 If
Of course I'm crying
Or if you expect to make a farewell party
And you're going to applaud
Destroying my life
Or that the fence run me go to church to ask God to bless

And no,
I can not forgive
Although I love you with all my soul you make me hate you
Today you laugh at me
It hurts me
But are you coming back to me and I warn you that I will avenge

You'll kiss the ground I swear to god
You will come to ask forgiveness and I doubt
And beg for a kiss on my lips
Your skin will beg to be touched my hands

I know I will enjoy when you come crying
And I'll see you make fun of dragging
You'll be sorry to have met me
Because today I declare your worst enemy

And what you deserve for abandoning his return is that you send
A scream elsewhere!

and see what I am Lady gaga
