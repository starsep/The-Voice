I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me,
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro

She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you
Won't look you at
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She got a halo around her finger
Around you

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to loose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro

Stop
Please, just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad
And those flames that burn before him
Now he's gonna firefight, gonna cool the bad

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to loose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro

Don't bother me
Don't bother me, Alejandro
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, bye Fernando
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch,
Fernando

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

Don't wanna kiss don't wanna touch
Just smoke my ciggarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto

Alejandro
Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro
Ale-ale-jandro (x2)

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just Smoke my ciggarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto
