How can you sit there and watch me scream?
Ooh you're my funny man.

Ooh you're my funny man.

You think it's funny to play with me
Do you think it's safe baby?
Wait and see.
My heart is not to be played with.
I am waiting a long time to say this.

I love you, I need you, I want you oh so bad.
I wish that I could forget the secrets that we've had.
I'm dying, I'm crying, that you're laughing like it's funny.
What's funny? What's funny? Lady Gaga is no dummy.

How can you sit there and watch me scream?
Ooh you're my funny man.

I can see what we had back then wasn't real.
You wear a disguise just to see how we feel.
You took my heart and, mamed it.
So hard too forget it.

I love you, I need you, I want you oh so bad.
I wish that I could forget the secrets that we've had.
I'm dying, I'm crying, that you're laughing like it's funny.
What's funny? What's funny? Lady Gaga is no dummy.

How can you sit there and watch me scream?
Ooh you're my funny man.

I want you to know, that it hurts to hear you laughing.
I wouldn't do that to you.
You stole my heart, you wrecked my soul.
Now tell me, what's so funny?

How can you sit there and watch me scream?
