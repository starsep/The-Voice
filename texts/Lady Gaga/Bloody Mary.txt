Love is just a history that they may prove 
And when you're gone I'll tell them my religion's you 
When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne 
I'm ready for their stones 

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands 
Above my head, head, head 
Like Jesus said

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance 
With my hands, hands, hands above my head 
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead because 

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do 
I won't cry for you see
When you're gone I'll still be bloody Mary 

We are not just art for Michelangelo 
To carve he can't rewrite the agro
Of my furied heart I'll wait 
On mountain tops in Paris cold 
Je ne veux pas mourire tout seule

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands 
Above my head, head, head 
Like Jesus said

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance 
With my hands, hands, hands above my head 
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead because 

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do 
I won't cry for you see
When you're gone I'll still be bloody Mary 

Dum dum da di da 
Dum dum da di da
Dittie da di da
Dum dum da di da
Dum dum da di da 
Dum dum da di da
Dittie da di da
Dum dum da di da

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do, do, do
I won't cry for you see
When you're gone I'll still be bloody Mary
