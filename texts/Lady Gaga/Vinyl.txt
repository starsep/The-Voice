Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey


I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
(Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek
Let's runaway
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and
Built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
Baby, baby, baby ohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine (oh oh)

For you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe, we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, But I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, Baby fix me
And just shake me til' you wake me from this bad dream
Chorus:
One love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Lemme tell you one time
(Girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time
(Girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always makin time for you
I'ma tell you one time
(Girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time
(Girl I love, girl I love you)

You look so deep
You know that it humbles me,
Your by my side and troubles them don't trouble me
Many have called but the chosen Is you
Whatever you want shawty I'll give it to you

Your world is my world (Your world)
And my fight is your fight (My fight)
My breath is your breath
And your heart (and now I've got my)

Chorus:
One love (Yeah yeah yeah)
My one heart
My one life for sure
Lemme tell you one time
(Girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (Hey)
(Girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy (one guy)
You'll be my number one girl
Always makin time for you
I'ma tell you one time
(Girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time
(Girl I love, girl I love you)

Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, I need it
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, tonight
I want your hot stuff
I got to feel it
Got to have your hot stuff
Got to have your love tonight

Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
I want you back

I remember the love in your eye
When you took my hand and said goodbye
I don't know where the river flows
"Flirt"

Flirt, flirt!

You wanna chill in my Lamborghini,
You wanna look but you don't wanna see
So what you think of that look in my eyes?
You think it's for you?
You think you read minds?
You better watch where you're putting those hands,
You better stop if you're making more plans
'Coz everything you do makes you look like a fool


You're looking for some dirt,
I'm lifting up my skirt
I'm searching for a light under me in my purse
You always think the worst,
I just wanna flirt
You found me on my knees,
Next thing you're saying "tease"
I'm trying to find my phone and my keys, not your sleaze
My spell is like a curse,
I just wanna flirt

What part of "No" don't you really understand? One-syllable word, old man?
You got a problem with my space?
Get your look out of my face
'Coz I've had it with your lies
You're pretty damn close to being unfine
'Cuz everything you do makes you look like a fool



I'm just so lucky to be walking on a wire,
I'm up so high that I can barely feel your fire
You can't touch me, no,
That's just a dream
Fill up my cup, mozoltov
Look at her dancing, just take it off
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof, and then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
And do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

'Cause I gotta feeling, woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling, woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

I'm a be, I'm a be I'm a I'm a I'm a be.
I'm a be, I'm a be I'm a I'm a I'm a be.
I'm a be, I'm a be I'm a I'm a I'm a be.
I'm a be be be be I'm a I'm a be.
I'm a be be be be I'm a I'm a be.
I'm a be be be be I'm a I'm a be.


I'm a be on the next level
I'm a be rockin' over that bass treble
I'm a be chillin' with my muthafuckin' crew
I'm a be makin' all them deals you wanna do
I'm a be up in that maylist flicks
Doin' 100 flips, and I'm a be
Sippin' on drinks cause
I'm a be shakin' my hips
You gon' be lickin' your lips
I'm a be takin' them pics
Lookin' all fly and shit
They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you,
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

She was more like beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round


She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round


People always told me be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful who you love
Be careful what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth


Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son


For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)


She told my baby we'd danced 'till three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin'
His eyes were like mine
Come on dance on the floor in the round, baby


People always told me be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
The smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
