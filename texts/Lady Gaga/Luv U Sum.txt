So lick your lips and brace your tongue
Get over here, you love me some

I see you baby, and I got it bad
I said it lady, I won't take it back
I just don, t know what's come over me
But if you taste like it look
Then you taste sugar sweet

Girl, so hot, make me lose my cool (cool)
May I suggest we head to the room (this room)
I just wanna be alone with you
I, m young but I know what I wanna do

Got your sugar right over here
Not saccharin or fake my dear
No-nonsense diet bay I'm
Your sugarcane, on your mind
It's nothin' you can't handle babe

So lick your lips and brace your tongue
Get over here, you love me some X2

Or maybe your perfume

The flashing libhgts, or the way you move (yeah)

Let me make your body boom boom
