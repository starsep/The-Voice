 Hello
Nice to meet you.
You are very cute.
Rubber man.

I cant help my self
I'm in love,
And when i get back from out of space
I'm gonna punch him in his face

If he's the moon
Then I'm eclipsed
I'm so lunar yeah when I get to him
I'll run him over with my rocket ship.

My eyeliner runs in constellations
For you dear
If only i could reboot my mechanical heart
I'd think clear

Baby I'm feeling so out of this world,
Baby with your I'm a different girl
Ohhh, ohhh you're my future love.

Baby could we make a home in the stars
Baby somewhere in a galaxy far
Ohh, ohh you're my future love

Ohhhh, I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love,
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu future man
I wanna fu- fuck you as hard as I can
Would you be in my fu- future plans
i want a fu-fu-fu future man.

I've been working in engineering
All our chemistries and our situations
Working out our sex equations,
And I know I'm no Nostradamus, yeah
Cause my hair is blond but my heart's brunette
If I'm not on you then at least I'm honest

My mascara runs in constellations
For you dear, my dear
If only I could outer space my brain
For a minute
I'd think clear (I love you so much)

Baby I'm feeling so out of this world,
Baby with your I'm a different girl
Ohhh, ohhh you're my future love.

Baby could we make a home in the stars
Baby somewhere in a galaxy far
Ohh, ohh you're my future love

Ohhhh, I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love,
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu future man
I wanna fu- fuck you as hard as I can
Would you be in my fu- future plans
i want a fu-fu-fu future man.

If you could only take me in
To a place we've never been
He is so unreal yeah! He's a mannequin
A synthetic, plastic, rubber man

And I'm relying on, on a shooting star
To get to you my future love ah ah
He's my rubber hunk, my mechanic guy
And I'm stuck in his metal rubber ey-ey-ey-eyes!
Rubber ey-ey-ey-eyes! my future guy

Parumpumpumpumpumpumpum.
