You make me feel so pretty,
When Im not feeling so cool today,
Yeah, you pull me out
when you know that Im afraid.
Something about you,
It dries up every tear in the way,

And when I trip myself on the sidewalk
You put my boots back on me, babe
Cause youre my cowboy, youre my everything
And you know how to get me

Sometimes Im feeling up, sometimes Im down
You lift my feet up off the ground
Sometimes Im moving fast, sometimes Im slow
You know how to make me go
Sometimes Im a happy girl you love
Sometimes I dont feel good enough
Sometimes, sometimes, oh
Youre there when I need you, sometimes
Uh oh, Uh ooh when I need you sometimes Uh oh, Uh ooh

I ask myself these questions
About you that I cannot explain
How you ride with me
When you know that Im to blame
Youve proved your love, I
Dont need to hear the words that you say

But I know you say them anyway
Just to keep me feeling sane
And my worries become yesterday
Baby, you get me

Sometimes Im feeling up, sometimes Im down
You lift my feet up off the ground
Sometimes Im moving fast, sometimes Im slow
You know how to make me go
Sometimes Im a happy girl you love
Sometimes I dont feel good enough
Sometimes, sometimes, oh
Youre there when I need you, sometimes

Uh oh, Uh ooh when I need you sometimes Uh oh, Uh ooh

And the world is becoming yesterday cuz baby know I.
