Some say when it rain it pours Hollywood anit no place for lovers any more and it anit no place for us. Some say when it rains it pours Hollywood anit no place for lovers any more and it anit no place for us.
A yo what the hell am I rhyming for
Designer clothes and designer whores
Designer cars and designer doors
Designer kitchen with designer draws
Hell naw xxxxxx dog the other xxxx wore me like a monologue
Like the beatles when they were bigger then Jesus
I'm genuis Bill Clinton with my speeches
Look you in the eye and lie
Believe it, I mean it.
Girl I'm leaving
I don't really know where I'm gon' go
But I got a backpack full of demos
I'm a player baby, I should run for mayer maybe.
The way I'm politiking latley.
The way I'm politiking ladies.
The way I'm politiking ladies.

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us
Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us

I'm convinced that if I hop the fence
I can climb on in and get my fingerprints on your booty, Julie,
I know you wanna do me.
Since I moved to malibu from the hood like a movie.
Peoples chant with my sneakers in the sand
Blowing up like an amp so they kicked me out the band
That's when I met my man strummin on a six string drink in his hand talking to his dingaling

Whys everybody always picking on me
Whys everybody always picking on me
Whys everybody always picking on me
Whys everybody still coming to my party.
