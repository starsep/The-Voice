In your brown eyes
I walked away
In your brown eyes
I couldn't stay
In your brown eyes
You'll watch her go
Then turn the record on
And wonder what when wrong
What went wrong?

If everything
Was everything
But everything is over
Everything
Could be everything
If only we were older
I guess it's just
A silly song about you
And how I lost you
And your
Brown eyes 

In your brown eyes
I was feeling low
Coz the brown eyes
And you never know
Gat some brown eyes
But I saw her face
I knew that it was wrong
So, babe turn the record on
Play that song

Where everything 
Was everything
But everything is over
Everything could be everything
If only we were older
I guess itâ€™s just
A silly song about you
And how I lost you
And your 
Brown eyes

Everything was everything
But baby it's the last show
Everything 
Could be everything
But it's time to say boodbye
So, it's your lst 'thanks' 
And your last tip
