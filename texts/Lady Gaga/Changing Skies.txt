Oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ohh
Oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oooh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I need somebody who calls my name
When clouds are smokin' up my way
You get me through these cha-changing skies

I don't wanna be afraid again
It's just that I could use a friend
You get me through these cha-changing skies

Give me something that I
Can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I can't handle now
Believe me when I say
That I will be okay
And listen this advise
And my cha-changing skies

Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Changing skies
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing

Ooh ooh ohh
Oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ohh
Oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oooh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

And I don't wanna be that kind of guy
I wanna dance way through the night
You get me through these cha-changing skies

Know that I am not emotional
It's just that I don't wanna fall
Without my parachute tonight

Give me something that I
Can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I can't handle now
Believe me when I say
That I will be okay
And listen this advise
And my cha-changing skies

Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Changing skies
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
