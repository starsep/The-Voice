what if i were to leave you
but then you fell back in love with me

how could you ever let me go
how could you ever ever let me go
i scream your name across the bar
i carry pictures of your
neil young
guitar guitar
though i just cant seem to forget you
not ever just as long as i left you
your my baby,you
never made it through to you
