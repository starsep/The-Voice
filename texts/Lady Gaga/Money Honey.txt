Thats m-o-n-e-y, so sexy

Damn, I love the Jag, the jet and the mansion
Oh yeah
And I enjoy the gifts and the trips to the islands
Oh yeah

It's good to live expensive
You know it
But my knees get weak intensive

When you give me k-kisses
That's money honey
Well I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money honey
Baby when you tear me to pieces
That's money honey

Thats m-o-n-e-y, so sexy

Damn, I love the boat by the beach on the west coast
Oh yeah
And I enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast
Oh yeah

It's good to live expensive
You know it
But my knees get weak intensive

When you give me k-kisses
That's money honey
Well I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money honey
Baby when you tear me to pieces
That's money honey

You know I appreciate the finer things
But its not what makes me happiest baby
(I can do without a thing)
The turn in loving is more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle baby, baby

K-K-K-Kisses
That's money honey
Well I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money honey
Baby when you tear me to pieces
That's money honey

When you give me k-kisses
That's money honey
Well I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money honey
Baby when you tear me to pieces
That's money honey

When you give me k-kisses
That's money honey
Well I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money honey
Baby when you tear me to pieces
That's money honey

Thats m-o-n-e-y, so sexy
