One look and I'm done
One glance from your eyes
And I'm captivated
The taste of your skin
The warmth of your hungry lips has 
Me so taken and I love the way you can
Make me dance from miles away
When I'm with you I am so sedated
I'm captivated by you

You're just like the wind because
Everything moves when you are around it
The sun is just like the sound of 
Your voice in the morning when you
Light my world up and I love the way you can
Make me dance from miles away
When I'm with you I am never jaded, I'm captivated

I never stopped believing in this crazy love we live in
Sugar, hold me close and make me sweeter, I need you, I love you

So please, show me that smile
Make me laugh for just a little while
And dream me one breath, 
I want to be one to fill the emptiness and
I love the way you can make
Me dance from miles away
It's been so long now, I waited and I'm captivated
