 Groove slam work it back
Filter that baby bump that track
Groove slam work it back
Filter that baby bump that track
Groove slam work it back
Space Cowboy just play that track
Gaga in the room so starstruck
cherry cherry cherry cherry boom boom

Rollin up to the club on the weekend
Stylin' out to the beat that you're freakin
Fantasize on the track that you're tweakin' blow my heart up
Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Cue me up on the twelve on your table

I'm so starstruck

Starstruck,
Baby could you blow my heart up ( x4)

Baby now that we're alone, got a request
Would you make me number one on your playlist
Got your dirty headphones
With the left side on
Wanna scratch it back and forth, back and forth uhuh
Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with your original flavor
Put the breakdown first, up into the chorus to the verse

Starstruck,
Baby could you blow my heart up ( x4)

[ Space Cowboy]:
Hey
Lil Mama
Really, really, is that him?
I have seen him before
When she got all them big rims
Give to that cash flow
My family they on trips
Shawty say hands up with
Your signature right here
Like I just a Dali Lai
And I'm supposed to sign
How she had it automatic
And I think it's goin' down
She so starstuck
The gal all struck
Aw----i had an overdose
Too many strarbucks
Ain't never seen a baller
Paper that stack taller
So let that top back on
That chevy impala
I'm having all that
Fully loaded with two starters
What did you call that
When your shawty win two dollars
But that's another chapter
So I'm a banchelor
How now me just
Spotted a baby actor
More free swagger
Bet on that dagger
Got what she want
Shawty happily ever after

Starstruck,
Baby could you blow my heart up ( x4)
