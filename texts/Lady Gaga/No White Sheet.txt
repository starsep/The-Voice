 It was impossible to get your memory from my mind
It was impossible to forget that one day I loved you
So much time passed since the day you left
There I learned that goodbyes are sad

I never imagined that a train will take you on your trip
Those illusions that we swore children
All your feelings are stored in your luggage
You wanted to comfort me and told me I love you,
Since then I knew it would be in your life
Since then I did not know if someday return
The friends of people wondered if he returned
Crying my back I will not say anything

Yesterday I return to my village
someone told me that since you got married
Look at me and tell me if I've forgotten,
I will go with watery eyes
then I asked the moon,
espaldea gave me attempt to hide
Even the moon knows you loved me,
to the moon knows I still love

And fly, fly, in other directions
are dreams and dreams that the world is yours
You can no longer fly with me
though my dreams will leave you
You can no longer fly with me
though my dreams will leave you.

It's so sad to tell you to forget me
Another love has come into my life and I do not want
It's late and I can not deny that I'm dying
But my words to tell you shut up
To dream with you whenever you close my eyes
Will sing for you my sad songs night after night
That llorare not remember you when I'm alone
And remembering that sleep in the arms of another man
I wonder if it still reflects something of my life
If your memory lives in the love of many years
The man who always loved you since childhood
crying for the love of his life he has married

it is sad that a train departs
and the best will in your life
tell me the reason of your departure
because you left leaving thousand sentences
one day I received your letter I wanted to read
and it was a blank sheet
your life because I never knew anything
as I love you even wonder if

And fly, fly, in other directions
are dreams and dreams that the world is yours
You can no longer fly with me
though my dreams will leave you

And fly, fly,
For other directions
are dreams and dreams that the world is yours
You can no longer fly with me
though my dreams will leave you

and I'm still the whore for you lady gaga
