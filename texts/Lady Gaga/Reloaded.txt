Baby you've got a lot of questions
You better listen up please
I wanna know what you want and need
To charge up your batteries

You got the flow and the intentions
Boy, but have you got the mouth
Show me that you've got the ammunition
That you're good for a while, for a while, for a while

Charge it up (charge it up) 
'Cause babe you're one of a kind
I don't need a red soldier
Need you to reload it
Bring it reloaded

Charge it up (charge it up) 
'Cause babe you're one of a kind
I don't need a red soldier
Need you to reload it
Bring it reloaded

Reloaded, loaded
Lo-oaded, lo-oaded

Relo-oa-de-ed, lo-oa-de-ed

Reloaded, loaded
Lo-oaded, lo-oaded
Reloaded, lo-oaded
Relo-oa-de-ed, lo-oa-de-ed

You better rest up your energy
You better reserve yourself
'Cause tonight I'm expecting to get plenty
And I won't let do it myself

Conserve your juices cause I'm gonna
Take you on a marathon
I'm not ridiculous I'm just a girl
Who likes a man who can't go wrong, can't go wrong, can't go wrong

Charge it up (charge it up) 
'Cause babe you're one of a kind
I don't need a red soldier
Need you to reload it
Bring it reloaded

Charge it up (charge it up) 
'Cause babe you're one of a kind
I don't need a red soldier
Need you to reload it

I'm gonna spin you when I doubt I'm gonna do you right
And I won't complain if your buggin
Can't handle my loving tonight, tonight, tonight
