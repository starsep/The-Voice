It's too much to mess and it stress me
Figure out and too much pressure on us, babe
Last night you took me to the mall
And then it started to get physical

We only been a one day, baby
Yeah, I know it was fun to start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call her incessantly, t-t-text me

Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could find it off but it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop calling us, stop calling
It's not in decision, just my female intuition
Doesn't mean you can't be calling me like that
Stop calling us, stop calling

I can't live with you, yes it's true or live without
The kinda guy that I'm...
You kiss me like a rockstar and
You always wanna hold my hand

But we only been a one day, baby
Yeah, I know it was fun to start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call her incessantly, t-t-text me

Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could find it off but it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop calling us, stop calling
It's not in decision, just my female intuition
Doesn't mean you can't be calling me like that
Stop calling us, stop calling

Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Oh no
[Repeat]

Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could find it off but it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop calling us, stop calling
It's not in decision, just my female intuition
Doesn't mean you can't be calling me like that
Stop calling us, stop calling
