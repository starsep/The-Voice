This is beat is so funny
We made it with their money
Hahahahahaha

(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)
Yeah, you're so fancy

See that girl, watch her go
Red high heels and pretty toes
Silly puddy ...
Lady's got a killer groove
And you've got a lot to lose

All the famous boys and girls
Stand around and pose
Everybody knows her
...

We all take off our clothes
Fancy clothes
Take off your fancy clothes

Oh baby, don't be shy
Fashion's got a ... eye
Everybody let's take off
Our fancy pants tonight
(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)
(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)

Grab those tight
And 'lease your bottoms
Don't leave home without a
Let's take off our fancy pants
(Fancy, fancy, you're so fancy)

This is beat is so funny
We made it with their money

Blue jeans with an ass like whoa

A girl's got a lot to lose

All the famous boys and girls
Putting up their nose
Everybody knows her

We all take off our clothes
Our fancy clothes
Take off your fancy clothes

Yeah baby, don't be shy
Fashion's got a ... eye
Everybody let's take off
