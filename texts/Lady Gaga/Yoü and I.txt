It's been a long time since I came around 
Been a long time but I'm back in town 
And this time I'm not leavin' without you 

You taste like whiskey when you kiss me awe 
I'd give anything again to be your babydoll 
This time I'm not leaving without you 

He said, sit back down where you belong 
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on 
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time 
And you said to me 

(There's somethin') 
Somethin', somethin' about this place 
Somethin' 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face 
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy 
Yeah, somethin' about baby you and I 

It's been two years since I let you go 
I couldn't listen to a joke or rock'n'roll
And muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me "Heart of Gold" 
With a guitar hummin' and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you 

Sit back down where you belong 
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on 
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time 
And you said to me 

(There's somethin') 
Somethin', somethin' about this place 
Somethin' 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face 
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy 
Yeah, somethin' about baby you and I 

You and I, you, you and I 
You, you and I, you, you and I 
You and I, you, you and I 
Oh yeah, I'd rather die without you and I 

(Come on, put your drinks up!) 

We gotta whole lotta money but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven 
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life 
It's my daddy, and Nebraska and Jesus Christ 

(There's somethin') 
Somethin', somethin' about the chase 
(6 whole years)
I'm a New York woman born to run you down 
Still want my lipstick all over your face 
There's somethin', somethin' about just knowin' when it's right 
So put your drinks up for Nebraska, for Nebraska, Nebraska I love ya

You and I, you, you and I 
Baby I'd rather die
Without you and I 
You and I, you, you and I 
Nebraska I'd rather die, without you and I 

It's been a long time since I came around 
Been a long time but I'm back in town 
And this time I'm not leaving without you
