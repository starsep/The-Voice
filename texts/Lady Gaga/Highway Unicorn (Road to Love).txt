We can be strong
We can be strong 
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love 
We can be strong 
We can be strong 
Follow that unicorn on the road to love 

Run, run with her top down, baby she flies
Run, run with the fury of a saint in her eyes 
Run, run ha cha cha cha baby she goes 
With blonde hair and a gun smokin' under her toes 

Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah 
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride, ride pony, ride, ride
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah 
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah 
Oh-oh-oo-oh 
Ride, ride pony tonight 

We can be strong
We can be strong 
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love 
We can be strong 
We can be strong 
Follow that unicorn on the road to love 

I'm on the roa-oa-oa-oa-oad 
I'm on the road to love 
I'm on the roa-oa-oa-oa-oad 
I'm on the road to love 

She's just an American ridin' a dream
And she's got a rainbow syrup in her heart that she bleeds 
She don't care if your papers or love is the law
She's a free soul burnin' roads with a flag in her bra 

Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah 
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride, ride pony, ride, ride
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah 
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah 
Oh-oh-oo-oh 
Ride, ride pony tonight 

We can be strong
We can be strong 
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love 
We can be strong 
We can be strong 
Follow that unicorn on the road to love 

I'm on the roa-oa-oa-oa-oad 
I'm on the road to love 
I'm on the roa-oa-oa-oa-oad 
I'm on the road to love 

Get your hot rods ready to rumble 
'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna drink until we die
Get your hot rods ready to rumble 
'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna drink until we die
