Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You don't have to go oh oh oh oh oh 
You don't have to go oh oh oh oh oh 
Baby please don't go

Ay ay ay ay ay ay 
All those tears I cry ay ay ay ay ay 
All those tears I cry ay ay ay ay ay 
Baby please don't go

When I read the letter that you wrote me, it made me mad, mad, mad 
When I read the news that it told me, it made me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so, I can't let you go 
I love you, ooh baby I love you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You hurt me to my soul oh oh oh oh oh 
You hurt me to my soul oh oh oh oh oh 
Baby please don't go

Ay ay ay ay ay ay 
Every breath I take ay ay ay ay ay ay 
Every move I make ay ay ay ay ay ay 
Baby please don't go

When I read the letter that you wroteme, it made me mad, mad, mad 
When I read the news that it told me, it made me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so, I can't let you go 
I love you, ooh baby I love you
