Oh oh oh yeah 
Oh babe

Last time 
I thought we have this talk
Boy you were getting ready to leave
I thought 
Baby you have done
Cause for a while you can barely look at me
This time I thought that we'll be fine
That I'd forget the things that you said
I tried crossing out your words
But baby you can not forget the past
Still baby

CHORUS:
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love
You see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around

We tried going back to JOE's
That alway was our favorite place
Long rides baby by the coast
Do you remember where we sit?
Last time we were hanging out
You were acting kind of a strange
Now it's the second time around
I'm sorry now it's me to feel this way
It's me to feel this way, baby
I know you are the one that it hurts


CHORUS:
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love
You see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around

I'm not sure the best way to say this
But I can't pretend to love you no more baby
This ferris wheel's got me crazy
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us baby
Not meant for us baby
Yeah

CHORUS:
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love
You see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around x2
