We are a generation twisted by a myth
Confused and ludicrous holding on to love
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst
A life without the lips we've kissed and losing all control

We're gonna start the resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this

Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever, we'll live together
Peace, love, solitude and happiness
Electric kiss

Fame is our felony, we're so in love with it
Some superstars and machosists who don't know where to go
But the poets and the fathers of our time
Put down their weapons in their arms
And know what they must do

They're gonna start the resistance
So they want independence
They're gonna give the world some of this

Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever, we'll live together
Peace, love, solitude and happiness

Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever, we'll live together
Peace, love, solitude and happiness
Electric kiss
