Hey babe,
I'm feelin' something kinda crazy.
I know that we got something special, boy.
But lately I've been feelin' naughtier,
Than usual
(You see I)

I need a love that's crazy don't you see?
I'm looking for someone that can handle me.
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so.
I'm sorry when I mention that I did not know.
