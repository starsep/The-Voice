Little Monsters of every age, wouldn't you like to see something strange?
Come with me and you will see, this my town of Gagaween

This is Gagaween
This is Gagaween
Monsters scream in the dead of night
This is Gagaween
Paparazzi make a scene
Trick or treat
'Cause baby I was born this way
It's my town, everybody scream

In the town of Gagaween
I am the Gaga hiding under your bed
Teeth grind sharp, and eyes bleeding red
I am the Gaga hiding under your stairs
Shoes like stilts and Kermit's in my hair

This is Gagaween
This is Gagaween
Gagaween
Gagaween
Gagaween
Gagaween

In this town I call home 
Put your paws up for the monster queen
In my town don't you love me now, 
Everybody is waiting for my next big hit

Everybody scream
Everybody scream
In her town of Gagaween

I am the Gaga with the skeleton face
Watch out with my hair I'll smack you in the face
I am the Gaga who likes to swear
Ya, I'm a boy I don't fucking care

This is Gagaween
This is Gagaween
Gagaween
Gagaween
Gagaween
Gagaween

Gagaween
Gagaween

In this town, don't you love me now
Everybody is waiting for my next big hit
Gaga is mother
I'm the little monster
Put your paws up for the monster queen now

This is Gagaween
This is Gagaween
Gagaween
Gagaween
Gagaween
Gagaween

In this town I call home
Put your paws up for the monster queen
