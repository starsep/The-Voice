Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Push it,
In Brooklyn
Painted green watermelon
That guy's ride
Is good-looking
Good-looking
He tells me that he loves me
And even though I'm real sexy
He loves his car, car, car
He's always with his car, car, car

So I...
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Push it,
In Brooklyn
Painted green watermelon
That guy's ride
Is good-looking
Good-looking
He tells me that he loves me
And even though I'm real sexy
He loves his car, car, car
He's always with his car, car, car

So I...
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Knock it,
Pump it,
Wash it,
Bump it
Rub that glitter and grease,
He loves it!
He's so fine, he makes her shiny,
There's more glitter and grease behind me

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around
