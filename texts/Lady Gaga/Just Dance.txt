Oh, yeah 

I’ve had a little bit too much (much) 
All of the people start to rush (start to rush by) 
Caught in this twist of dance, can’t find my drink or man 
Where are my keys? I lost my phone (phone) (oh oh oh oh) 

What’s go-ing on on the floor? 
I love this record baby, but I can’t see straight anymore 
Keep, it cool, what’s the name of this club? 
I can’t remember but it’s alright, a-alright (czytaj: oł-ołrait)

Just dance, gonna be okay (da-da-doo-doo) 
Just dance, spin that record babe (da-da-doo-doo) 
Just dance, gonna be okay (duh-duh-duh) 
Dance, dance, dance, just ju-ju-just dance 

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth (oh oh oh oh) 
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? (inside out, right) 
Control your poison babe, roses with thorns they say 
And we’re all gettin’ hosed tonight (oh oh oh oh) 

What’s go-ing on on the floor? 
I love this record baby, but I can’t see straight anymore 
Keep, it cool, what’s the name of this club? 
I can’t remember but it’s alright, a-alright 

Just dance, gonna be okay (da-da-doo-doo) 
Just dance, spin that record babe (da-da-doo-doo) 
Just dance, gonna be okay (duh-duh-duh) 
Dance, dance, dance, just ju-ju-just 

When I come through on the dance floor checkin' out that catalogue 
Can’t believe my eyes so many women without a flaw 
And I ain’t gon’ give it up, steady try'na pick it up like a car 
I’ma hit it, I'ma hit it and flex until until tomorrow yeah 

Show me I can see that you got so much energy 
The way you twirlin' up them hips round and round 
There's no reason at all why you can't leave here with me 
In the meantime stand, let me watch you break it down and 

Dance, gonna be okay (da-da-doo-doo) 
Just dance, spin that record babe (da-da-doo-doo) 
Just dance, gonna be okay (da-da-doo-doo) 
Just dance, spin that record babe (da-da-doo-doo) 
Just dance, gonna be okay (duh-duh-duh) 
Dance, dance, dance, just ju-ju-just dance 

Half psychotic sync hypnotic 
Got my blueprint it's symphonic 
Half psychotic sync hypnotic 
Got my blueprint electronic 
Half psychotic sync hypnotic 
Got my blueprint it's symphonic 
Half psychotic sync hypnotic 
Got my blueprint electronic 

Go 
Use your muscle comin out work and hustle 
I got it, just stay close enough to get it 
Go slow 
Drive it, clean it, Lysol, bleed it, spend the last dough, in your pocko 


Just dance, gonna be okay (da-da-doo-doo) 
Just dance, spin that record babe (da-da-doo-doo) 
Just dance, gonna be okay (da-da-doo-doo)
