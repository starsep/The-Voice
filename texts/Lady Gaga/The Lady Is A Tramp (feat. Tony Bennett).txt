She gets too hungry for dinner at eight (I'm starving!)
She loves the theater but she never comes late
I never bother with people that I hate
That's why this chick is a tramp
She doesn't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
And I definitely won't dish the dirt with the rest of those girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I love the free fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm so broke, it's oke!
I hate California
It's crowded and damp
That's why the lady is a tramp (I'm a tramp!)

Sometimes I go to Coney Island
Oh, the beach is divine
And I love the Yankees
Gee that's just fine!
I follow Rogers and Hart
She sings every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I love the prize fight
That isn't a fake (no fakes)
And I love the robot with you and your wife in Central Park way
She goes to the opera and stays wide awake (yes I do)
That's why this lady is a tramp

She likes the green grass under her shoes
What can I lose, 'cause I got no door (oh no?)
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp
Go!

I love your free fresh, I love your handkerchief in my hair
Life without care
But I'm so broke, it's oke!
Hates California
It's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
That's why the lady is a tramp

That's why the lady is a tramp
