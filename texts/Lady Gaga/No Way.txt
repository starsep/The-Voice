I saw a shadow, and I knew that it wasn't mine
You and her, I know that you are intertwined
Even though, her clothes were on and everything
Your eyes were somewhere else and you were both to blame

Don't say a word
I'm sure that it won't be enough
To erase what I know just happens now what dreams are made of
This is my house and I won't allow that disrespect
Baby don't look at me like that
Don't belong to you, anyway

CHORUS:
Cuz baby now that your caught what am I supposed to say
Its so wrong what you did but I still feel this way
I cant believe it, or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying answer is no way
No Way No Way
No Way (I cant believe it babe)
No Way (No Way)

Something I saw, something I know did not belong to me
But then I thought theres no way you would do that to me
Then last week, when you went aside to use your phone
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold
And I just woke up, but I wish that it was a nightmare
Cos when I have those, it isn't real like this one is
This is my heart, and I won't allow that disrespect
Baby don't look at me like that, it don't belong to you, anyway

CHORUS:
Cuz baby now that your caught what am I supposed to say
Its so wrong what you did but I still feel this way
I cant believe it, or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying answer is no way
No Way No Way
No Way (I cant believe it babe)
No Way (No Way)

Get your things and go
You can take the dinner leftover from last night
I made your favorite goodbye

CHORUS:
Cuz baby now that your caught what am I supposed to say
Its so wrong what you did but I still feel this way
I cant believe it, or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying answer is no way
No Way No Way
No Way (I cant believe it babe)
No Way (No Way)
