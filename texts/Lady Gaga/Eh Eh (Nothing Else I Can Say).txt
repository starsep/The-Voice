Cherry cherry
Boom boom
Gaga

Boy we've had a real good time
And I wish you the best
On your way, eh eh

I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought we'd fall
Out of place, eh eh

I have something that I love long long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me
That something's wrong
Then I met someone
And eh, there's nothing else I can say

Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh

Not that I don't care about you
Just that things got so compliqu√©
Eh eh

I met somebody cute and funny
Got each other and that's funny
Eh eh

I have something that I love long long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me
That something's wrong
Then I met someone
And eh, there's nothing else I can say

Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh

I have something that I love long long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me
That something's wrong
Then I met someone
And eh, there's nothing else I can say

Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh

Eh eh, cherry cherry, boom boom

Eh eh, eh eh
Oh, yeah
All I can say is eh eh
