INTRO:
You got me going gaga
Going crazy lady gaga
You got me going
Going in love
You got me going
Going wild &amp; free
Baby

VERSE 1:
Something got got me
Going crazy he heh
You and I are so exclusively
Meant to be
La toir seshuaj
Le funtemarihagi

CHORUS:
I wanna kiss &amp; run and hide
After all
I did to you

I wanna Jump and Scream
Maybe suicide
'Cause I'm so bad girl
For you

I wanna Kiss &amp; run and hide
'Cause, Baby I
I'm addicted to you

VERSE 2:
Kiss me in the dark
Maybe Dance with me
But I, need to go
Now 'cause It's 12 in the midnight
MY family's comin' out
And prey at you
So you gota before It's too late
Baby
La fotunato de
La tortura sumakashio



BRIDGE:
Stop
Stop
Stop
Stop
Baby stop lovin' me

I never wanted your
Life to be in danger
So
Jump
Jump
Jump
Jump 'cause you gotta save your life
'Cause I am a monster...
Rawr




I Gotta kiss &amp; run and hide...
