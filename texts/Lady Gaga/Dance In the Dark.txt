Silicone, saline, poison, inject me baby
I'm a free bitch, I'm a free bitch

Some girls won't dance to the beat of the tribe
Won't walk away but she won't look back
She looks good but her boyfriend says she's a mess,
She's a mess, she's a mess, now the girl is trash
She's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Run, run
Her kiss is a vampire grin 
Moonlight's away while she is howling at him
She looks good but her boyfriend says she's a tramp
She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still does her dance
She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still kills her dance

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

She loves to dance in the dark
(Dance in the dark)
She loves, she loves to dance in the dark

Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia, tell him how you feel girls
Work your blond Benet Ramsey will haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick
You will never fall apart Diana
You're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
