I don't know why you hurt inside
Or what was said that make you cry
I hope that you can see you are
The greatest thing to me and when
You feel like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I lift you up
I hope that you can see you are
The greatest, greatest thing to me

I don't wanna waste another day
I'm taking of you that made him my day and
Walk and see you once another day
'Cause when I'm with you I fall apart
I see you permanently broken heart
Baby you're the greatest to me know the matter what
(What, what)

I don't know why you hurt inside
Or what was said that make you cry
I hope that you can see you are
The greatest thing to me and when
You feel like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I lift you up
I hope that you can see you are
The greatest, greatest thing to me

I don't wanna waste another day
I'm taking of you that made him my day and
Walk and see you once another day
'Cause when I'm with you I fall apart
I see you permanently broken heart
Baby you're the greatest to me know the matter what
(What, what)

I don't know why you hurt inside
Or what was said that make you cry
I hope that you can see you are
The greatest thing to me and when
You feel like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I lift you up
I hope that you can see you are
The greatest, greatest thing to me
