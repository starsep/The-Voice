I give you call but you've not answering
I give thumbs-up but you don't care
I'm always wrote a song but you've not even sing along
I'll give you rose that have thorns

C'mon lets jump that I realize that I love you
C'mon lets walk for your famous dress
Hold back and take a breath be come closer to you and I

So glamorous and so infinity
Love takes over our heart

It's not matter but it's so solid that can't break
Rose Thorns I love it!
Rose Thorns that I gave tou
I have a question! That if care it Rose Thorns?
If you answer yes so prove it!
Rose Thorns-tho-thorns-tho-thorns
Rose Thorns

I know that you busy but you've so late that I hate you
You said you came but your shadows not appearing to me
So give it up so give it up so raise it up

Finally I found you my Jony dog
Finally I found you my missing God
So glamorous and so infinity
Love takes over our heart

It's not matter but it's so solid that can't break
