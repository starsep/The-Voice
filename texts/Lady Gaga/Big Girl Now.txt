I'm big boy, you're a big girl now
I'm a big girl, you're a big boy now
Back in the day, when you were young (It was fun)
Little girl, didn't think you were the one (Now, here I come)
Your sexy walk, your sexy talk (That's what's up)
Little girl, you're clearly not the same kid from the block
I ain't that little girl no more, not no more, that's for sure
Boy, get ass out on the floor, lets explore, lets explore

[Chorus:]
You know I like the way you move it (move it)
Girl, you're all grown up and now you're ready to let it go
Wanna be a big girl 'bout to prove it (prove it)
With a body like that, you got a grown man ready to blow

I'm big boy, you're a big girl now
I'm a big girl, you're a big boy now
Back in the day, when I was young (Kinda dumb)
But I always knew I'd be the one (Now, here you come)
Gonna get you wet, gonna make you sweat
Gonna give you something you ain't never gonna forget
Well, you ain't a little girl, not no more, that's for sure
Wanna work it like a big girl, lets explore
Drop it to the floor, baby, get more

[Chorus 2x]

I'm big boy, you're a big girl now
I'm a big girl, you're a big boy now
I'm big boy, you're a big girl now
I'm a big girl, you're a big boy now
I've been waiting too long for you to get naughty
Eat this and daddy, come on touch my body
I see that good things come to those who wait
Come take me on before it's too late

[Chorus 2x]
