No where yah
Were goin'
No where fast
Maybe this time
I'll be yours
You'll be mine

Crazy
Get your ass in my bed
Maybe you'll be just
My summer boyfriend
Summer boy

Let's get lost
You can take me home
Somewhere nice
We can be alone

Bikini top's
Comin' off
Don't be sad
When the sun goes down
You'll wake up
And I'm not around

I've got to go
Oh, oh, oh
Well still have
The summer after all
