Is a big (big) world
Is easy to get lost (baby)
You've always been my girl
And i'm not ready to go


We make the sun shine in the moon light
We can make the greay clouds in blue skies
I know is hurth
But baby believe me
That we can't go


Nowhere but up
From here
My dear
Baby we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what got to fear
We are taking to the sky pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as you are with me baby
Honestly with the strenght of our love
We can go nowhere but up

Is a big (big) world
And i'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna lish you with pearls
From every ocean
That we've swim in it


We make the sun shine in the moon light
We can make the greay clouds in blue skies
I know is hurth
But baby believe me
That we can't go

Nowhere but up
From here
My dear
Baby we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what got to fear
We are taking to the sky pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as you are with me baby
Honestly with the strenght of our love
We can go nowhere but up

Baby we were undergroug
We are on the surface now
We are gonna make it girl
I promise
If you believe in love
And you believe in us
We can't go now here but up

Baby we can go


Now here but up
From here
My dear
Baby we can go now here but up
Tell me what got to fear
We are taking to the sky pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as you are with me baby
Honestly with the strenght of our love
We can go nowhere but up

Nowhere but up
Nowhere but up
Yeah
Nowhere but up
