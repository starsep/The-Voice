(Ohhwoooaaah)X3

Everybody's looking for love.Oh.Oh
Ain't that the reason you're at this club.Oh.Oh
You ain't gonna find it dancing with him.No.Oh
Got a better solution for you girl.Oh.Oh

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like
Baby, baby, baby noo
Like
Baby, baby, baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
In my head, you'll be screamin' ohh...
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down.

So, I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

Oh oh
Cause you were Romeo, I was the scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "stay away from Juliet"
But you were my everything to me
I was begging you, please don't go
And I said

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like
Baby, baby, baby noo
Like
Baby, baby, baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
In my head, you'll be screamin' ohh...
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down.

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, no one could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh I was star-struck,
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks(Woo! )
She made my heart pound, I skip a beat when I see her in the street
And at school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing cuz she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

Baby, baby, baby ohh
Like
Baby, baby, baby noo
Like
Baby, baby, baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
In my head, you'll be screamin' ohh...
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down.

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talk to your dad
Go pick out a white dress
It's a love story
Baby, just say yes

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
