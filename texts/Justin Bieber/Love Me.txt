Oh, Oh
It's J.B

My Friends say I'm a fool,
To Think that you're the one for me,
I Guess I'm just a sucker for love,
'Cuz honestly the truth is ,
That you know I'm never leaving,
'Cuz you're my angel,
Sent from above,
'Cuz Baby you can do no wrong,
My money is yours,
Give you little more
Because I love ya, love ya,
With me girl is where you belong,
Just stay right here,
I promise my Dear
I'll put nothing' above ya, above ya.

Love me, love me,
say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh How you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna' hear
Tell me you love me, love me
say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh How you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna' hear
Tell me you love me.


People try to tell me
but I still refuse to listen
'Cuz they don't get
to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more
than a thousand days without your love
Oh your love.
Oh, oh
and Baby you can do no wrong,
My money is yours,
Give you little more
Because I love ya, love ya
With me girl is where you belong,
Just stay right here,
I promise my Dear
But nothing' above ya, above ya.


Love me, love me,
say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh How you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna' hear
Tell me you love me, love me
say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh How you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna' hear
Tell me you love me.


My heart is blind
but i don't care
'Cuz when I'm with you
Everything has disappeared
and every time I hold you near
I never wanna let you go , Oh

Love me, love me,
say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh How you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna' hear
Tell me you love me, love me
say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh How you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna' hear
Tell me you love me.
