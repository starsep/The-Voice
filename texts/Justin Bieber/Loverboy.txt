Da da da da da da da da etc.
Hell had you by the throat 
You never got to heaven 
But you got real close 
Your past has you in a chokehold, 
But you deserve it from what I've been told 
Call my bluff saying what do you want, 
I'm looking down at you from the top, 
I beg for attention in small doses, 
Leave the scene smelling of dead roses

Lo-oo-oo-ver bo-o-oy, you play those hearts like toys
Don't you feel bad, don't you feel bad 
Feel bad for them?

This is your night with arms wide open, 
I'm the option you shouldn't have chosen, 
Scared of the dark the door's wide open 
This is a night you'll regret in the morning.

Loverboy, you're playing those hearts like toys, 
Don't you feel bad, don't you feel bad
Feel bad for them?
If given the choice would you do it again?
Of course I would, of course I should, 
Well I'm your friend, friends with benefits. 

Da da da da da da da da da etc.
Loverboy, you're playing those hearts like toys, 
Don't you feel bad, don't you feel bad
Feel bad for them?
If given the choice would you do it again?
Of course I would, of course I should, 
Well I'm your friend, friends with benefits.
