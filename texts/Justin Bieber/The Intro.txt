Hey what’s up guys this is Justin Bieber
And this is the BEST DJ in the whole world his name is DJ Tay James
He’s kinda cool

You’re now tuning in to the We Know The DJ Radio

Black rims
Black body
Bad girls, you should act naughty
Oh that's your girl? I met in the lobby
If you’re in my section baby girl you here to party

VIP, you know it boy
Make a milli at the show, just to throw it boy
Said this goes out to all the haters
I’m a young Tunechi, kicking it with pro skaters
Oh my goodness (Why you wearing two rollies?)
I got time and I got money, and I got girls like it’s not funny
Honey, honey. what you want from me
C’mon bunny my-my bunny, my playboy bunny
I open the door
Walk in the store
She sees it’s me she says “hello”
I say “what’s good?” she says “let’s go”
So took her home, take it off

Black rims
Black body
Bad girls, you should act naughty
Oh, that’s your girl? On my Ducatti?
If you’re in my section baby girl you here to party

Never did I, think that I would get here
Now you know I’m flyin’ on the jet here
Momma said remember don’t forget dear
So ahead of everybody you the best here

Black rims
Black body
Bad girls, you should get naughty
Oh, that’s your girl? I met in the lobby
If you’re in my section girl you here to party
