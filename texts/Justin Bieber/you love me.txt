My friends say I'm a fool to think
that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
'Cuz honestly the truth is that
you know I'm never leavin'
'Cuz you're my angel sent from above

Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothin above ya. above ya

Love me, Love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, Fool me
Oh how you do me

Kiss me, Kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you (love me)

People try to tell me
but I still refuse to listen
Cuz they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
a thousand days without your love, oh your love

My heart is blind but I don't care
'Cuz when I'm with you everything has disappeared
And every time I hold you near
I never wanna let you go, oh
