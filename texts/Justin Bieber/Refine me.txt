I come into this place burning to receive your peace
I come with my own chains
From wars I've fought for my own selfish gain
You're my God and my father
I've accepted your son
But my soul feels so empty now
What have I become?
Lord come with your fires,
burn my desires refine me
Lord, my will has deceived me
please come and free me
Refine me, refine me
My heart can't see
When I only look at me
My soul can't hear
When I only think of my own fears
They are gone in a moment
You're forever the same
Why did I look away from You
How can I speak Your name?
Lord, come with Your fire,
burn my desires, refine me
Lord, My will has deceived me
Please come and free me
Come rescue this child
For I long to be reconciled to you
Refine me... All I can do
Is lift my heart and soul to You
And pray, oh I will pray...
