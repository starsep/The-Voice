You've got that smile, That only heaven can make. I pray to God everyday, That you keep that smile.
[Justin Bieber]Yeah, you are my dream, There's not a thing I won't do. I'll give my life up for you, Cos you are my dream.
[Bridge]And baby, everything that I have is yours, You will never go cold or hungry. I'll be there when you're insecure, Let you know that you're always lovely. Girl, cos you are the only thing that I got right now
[Chorus]One day when the sky is falling, I'll be standing right next to you, Right next to you. Nothing will ever come between us, I'll be standing right next to you, Right next to you.
[Chris Brown]You had my child, You make my life complete. Just to have your eyes on little me, That'd be mine forever.
