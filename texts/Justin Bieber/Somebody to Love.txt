Ohhhhh ohoooooo
For you i'd write a syphoney!

I'd tell the violin
It's time to sink a swim
Watchn' play for yaaaa!

For you i'd be
Wohaaa

But in a thousand miles just get you where you are
Step to the beat of my heart.
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I need I
I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine!
I know that I won't be the first one given you all this attention
But Baby listen,

I just need somebody to love
I-I
I don't need to much
Just need Somebody to love.
(just need sombody to love)

I don't need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear.
I just need somebody to love.

(I need somebody I-I need somebody
I need somebody I-I need somebody)

Everyday I bring the sun around,
I sleep away the clouds.
Smile for me (Smile for me)
I would take,
every second,
every single time spend it like my last dime.
Step to the beat of my heart.
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I need I
I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine!
I know I won't be the first one,
given you all this attention.
Baby listen!

I just need somebody to love,
I don't need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear.
I just need somebody to love.

(Repeat 2)
I need somebody,
I-I need somebody,
I need somebody,
I-I need somebody.
(Somebody to loooove, somebody to looove.)
I just need somebody to love.

And you can have it all,
anything you want.
I can bring you, give you,
the finer things yeah!
But what I really want,
I can't find 'cause,
money can't find me.
Somebody to love.

Ohhhhh Whoaaaa

Find me somebody to love oohhh.
I need somebody to love,
I-I don't need to much
just somebody to love.
Somebody to love.
I don't need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear,
I just need somebody to love.

I need somebody,
I-I need somebody,
I need somebody,
I-I need somebody.
I need somebody,
I-I need somebody,
I need somebody,
(I swear i just need somebody to love)
I-I need somebody.

Oh Oh.

I just need somebody to love.
