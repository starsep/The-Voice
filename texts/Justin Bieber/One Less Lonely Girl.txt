How many I told you's
And start overs and shoulders
Have you cried on before
How many promises be honest girl
How many tears you let hit the floor
How many bags you packed
Just to take 'em back, tell me that
How many either or's
But no more,
If you let me inside of your world
There'd be one less lonely girl

(Chorus)
Oh no
I saw so many pretty faces
Before I saw you, you
Now all I see is you
Oh no
Don't need these other pretty faces
'Cause when your mine in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what your worth
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February
Not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs saw you taping back
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more,
If you let me inside of your world

(Chorus)
Oh no
I saw so many pretty faces
Before I saw you, you
Now all I see is you
Oh no
Don't need these other pretty faces
'Cause when your mine in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what your worth
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart
I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe,
I just wanna set one girl free to fall
She's free to fall
With me
My hearts locked and nowhere to get the key
I'l take her and leave this world
With one less lonely girl

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
Yaaaah
only you shawty
