You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going that's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love
I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool(trying to be cool)
Whatcha expect me to do(ohh yeah)

I'm just trying to find, find, find; sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us(never be enough)(I won't stop until I find) my runaway love

See my baby really needs some help
Cause she can never stay at home by herself
She says she needs a little company
Even if she's not always with me yeahh, ohh

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool(trying to be cool)
Whatcha expect me to do(ohh yeah)
I'm just trying to find, find, find; sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?

Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us(never be enough)(I won't stop until I find) my runaway love
Why can't I find (why can't I find) the love of mine
When you're standing right in front of my face

Oh, I must be blind, how did I let you get away? (yeah, yeah)
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us(never be enough)
(I won't stop until I find) my runaway love

I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us(never be enough)
