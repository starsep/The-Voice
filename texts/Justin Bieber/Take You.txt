Hey, what's the situation?
I'm just tryna make a little conversation, why the hesitation?
Tell me what your name is, for your information, don't get me wrong
You know it's right, don't be so cold, we could be fire
Tomorrow we go, let's start tonight
You know what it's all about

I can take you up, I can take you home
I can take you oh-oh-oh where you wanna go
I can pick it up, we could take it slow
I can take you home
I can take you up, I can take you home
I can take you oh-oh-oh where you wanna go
I can pick it up, we could take it slow
I can take you home

I might have a reputation, oh oh, but it's only me and you in this equation
Promise this occasion, oh oh, it's a different situation
For your information, don't get me wrong
You know it's right, don't be so cold, we could be fire
Tomorrow we go, let's start tonight
You know what it's all about

I can pick it up, we could take it slow
I can take you home

I can take you up, I can take you home
