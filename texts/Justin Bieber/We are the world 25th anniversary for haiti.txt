There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dyin' and it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somehow will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know love is all we need

CHORUS:

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's star givin'
There's a choice we're makin'
We're savin' our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just U and me

Send them your heart 
So they know that someone cares
So their cries for help will not be in vein
We can't let them suffer
No, we cannot turn away
Right now they need a helpin' hand

CHORUS:

Nou se mond la, we are the children etc...

When your down &amp; out 
There seems no hope at all
But if U just believe
There's no way we can fall
Well, well, well, let us realize
That a change can only come when we
Stand together as one

CHORUS

We all need somebody that we can lean on
When you wake up, look around &amp; see that
Your dream's gone, when the earth quakes,
We'll help you make it through the storm
When the floor brakes, a magic carpet to stand on
We are the world united by love so strong
When the radio isn't on U can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road you're walkin' on
A sign post to find the dreams though was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on 
Someone to help to rebuild after the rubble's gone
We are the world connected by a common bond 
L O V E! The whole planet singin' along!

CHORUS

Everyday Citizens, everybody pitchin' in
Nou se mond la, nou se timoun yo
U and I, U and I
Twelve days no water, wishin' will to live
We amplified, watchin' it multiply
Feeli' like the World's end
We can make the World win
Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia
And now Haiti needs us, they need us, they need us

CHORUS

Haiti, Haiti
