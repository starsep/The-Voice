You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance, made other plans
But I betcha didn't think that they would come crashin down, no

You don't have to say, whatcha did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There will never be
Don't it make you sad about it

You told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone

Girl I refuse
You must have me confused with some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry

Cry me a river 
Cry me a river -er-er
cry me a river
cry me a river -er-er 
Ya, ya 

You don't have to say, whatcha did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There will never be
Done it make you sad about it

You told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
