Aye, it's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
Under the mistletoe, yeah

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chillin' with my folks, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
Word on the streets Santa's coming tonight
Reindeers flying thru the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

Hey love, the Wise Men followed a star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Aye love, don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing
Your lips on my lips
That's a Merry Merry Christmas

It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe
Sing it again
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe, yeah

Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
