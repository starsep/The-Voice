Wake up in the mornin' to my alarm clock ringin'
Go downstairs... two lines of coke.
The eyes widen and my brain stings, but one more moment and it's gone.

The bitch keeps screaming, so I gas her some more.
The low moans gradually fade to silence and asleep falls the whore.
2am and I'm down there again, stroking her gently while she's tied to the
bed.

She's growing thinner; I haven't fed her for weeks,
The only liquid she gets is too salty for hydration.

She died last night, while in my arms,
I know she loved me, but she just didn't know.

I'll take the.45 and stick it in my mouth,
Aim for the north but I'll be headed down south.
