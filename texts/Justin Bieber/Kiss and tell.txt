Yeah, J-J-J J.B yeah whoaaa ooooh
no, no
Now you see girl you ain’t gotta say nothing
Your lips are callin me like they wanna do something
I feel like it gettin straight with the things we make
A little kisses are definitely if i have a feel a thing
See you a couple times had a couple conversations
That you have been on my mind that a couple observations
Like you were by a chance you could be my chick
Play by the rules you be here when i get
To keep it quiet keep it on my heart (ye-yeah)
And when we do keep it just between us (ye-yeah)
I don’t want to see tweet about J.B
Cause only people that you know was you and me so
Chorus
Baby, I know that you cool with rockin with me
But I can’t have you tellin everybody
You got me all kissin with your lips like this
So tell me tell me how you gonna kiss
kiss and tell
Tell me how your gonna kiss
Kiss and tell
Tell me how your gonna kiss me
Then tell everybody you got me kissing
With your lips girl, all you gonna kiss and tell
Its called a date short no one has to do with it
You and me girl, tellin em’ were doin it
Don’t need that PMG, all in our privacy
Use em’ for kissin girl if you wanna ride with me
And if you wanna tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off
(No Problem)
We can go your way and I’ll go mine
But I rather spend a little time with you (yeah)
To keep it quiet keep it on my heart (ye-yeah)
And when we do keep it just between us (ye-yeah)
I don’t want to see tweet about J.B
Cause only people that you know was you and me so
Chorus
Baby, I know that you cool with rockin with me
But I can’t have you tellin everybody
You got me all kissin with your lips like this
So tell me tell me how you gonna kiss
kiss and tell
Tell me how your gonna kiss
Kiss and tell
Tell me how your gonna kiss me
Then tell everybody you got me kissing
With your lips girl, all you gonna kiss and tell
Tell said, all you gonna kiss and tell
(repeat)
Kiss and tell
Oooh don’t tell your homies
Don’t tell you mama
Don’t tell your girlfriend
Now they’ll start some drama
Stay off that facebook, i’ll treat you real good
You keep this private and you can get what i get
Chorus
Baby, I know that you cool with rockin with me
But I can’t have you tellin everybody
You got me all kissin with your lips like this
So tell me tell me how you gonna kiss
kiss and tell
Tell me how your gonna kiss
Kiss and tell
Tell me how your gonna kiss me
Then tell everybody you got me kissing
With your lips girl, all you gonna kiss and tell
