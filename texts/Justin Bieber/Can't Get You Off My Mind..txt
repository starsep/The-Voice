Verse 1:
I messed up the first part of our love. I messed up our relationship. I know what we had came from above. but I don't know if this is it. every day I talk to your picture. hangin on my wall. sayin how much I miss her, I miss it all...

Chorus:
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't have let you go. all the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't get you off my mind.

Verse 2:
I messed up your life. I messed up my time. I know what we had was all right. but I don't know if you cry at night. sayin to your parents, saying I am bad. telling them. "he was all that I had."

Chorus:
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't have let you go. all the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't get you off my mind.

Verse 3:
What we had is dead and gone. it will be too long. before me and you are together. but I guess not anymore...

Chorus:
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't have let you go. all the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't get you off my mind.

(Yeah) (yeah) woahhhh! (yeah) (yeah) can't get you off my mind.
