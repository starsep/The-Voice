If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would, I would

Baby do it to the sky and you the keys, you
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave, oh
Why you owe those fancy things that you only see on TV, yeah
Run away, to a hut away, we'll be living the american dream
And I, know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that he wanted us to try

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby I would

To the love forever why, so that it never runs dry
Anytime you ask me why I'm smiling, say that i'm satisfied
He got his flaws and so do I, past seven, and macy pride
And though I wanna make it right
I just can't read your mind

And i, know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that he wanted us to try

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh, baby I would

Yeah, it's not about what I want
It's all about what you need
I know that it hurt you, but that wasn't me
And I know, and I know sometimes it's hard to see
That all we need to be

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh baby I would
