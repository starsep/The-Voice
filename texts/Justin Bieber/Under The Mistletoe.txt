Spreading so much cheer, I should be playing in the winter snow, But Ima be
Under the mistletoe.
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday, But I can't stop staring at your
Face, I should be playing in the winter snow, But Ima be under the mistletoe.
With you, shawty with you, With you, shawty with you, With you, under the
Mistletoe, yeah.
Everyone's gathering around the fire, Chestnuts roasting like a hot July, I

High, I should be making a list, I know, But Ima be under the mistletoe.
With you, shawty with you, With you, shawty with you, With you, under the
Mistletoe, Yeaaa.

Mistletoe.
Hey love, the Wise Men followed a star, The way I followed my heart, And it
Led me to a miracle.

On my lips, That's a Merry Merry Christmas.
It's the most beautiful time of the year, Lights fill the streets spreading
So much cheer, I should be playing in the winter snow, But Ima be under the
Mistletoe.
