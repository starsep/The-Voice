In the night, I hear 'em talk,
the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless..
How could you be so heartless?
Oh.. How could you be so heartless?

You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
You took a chance, made other plans
But I betcha didn't think that they would come crashin down, no

You don't have to say, whatcha did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There will never be
Don't it make you sad about it

In the night, I hear 'em talk,
the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless..
How could you be so heartless?
Oh.. How could you be so heartless?
