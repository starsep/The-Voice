 Girl you don’t know how I feel
Since you been away oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call?
If I called you today
You say that you don’t wanna talk but it’s cool
Been thinkin’ about you all day long, hopin you’ll pick up your phone
And I know that I don’t wanna lose your love oh baby, oh baby
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cuz I really wanna be alone
Baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on alone

Don’t tell me you’re my heartbreaker
Cuz girl my heart’s breaking
Don’t tell me you’re my heartbreaker
Cuz girl my heart’s breaking (heartbreaker)

Hey girl
Girl you see me standing here, standing in the rain oh baby
Any chance that you could stay right here?
And never go away?
You say that you don’t wanna talk but it’s cool
Been thinkin’ about you all day long, hopin you’ll pick up your phone
And I know that I don’t wanna lose your love oh baby, oh baby
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cuz I really wanna be alone
Baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on alone

Don’t tell me you’re my heartbreaker
Cuz girl my heart’s breaking
Don’t tell me you’re my heartbreaker
Cuz girl my heart’s breaking (heart is breaking)

So what I’m really tryin to say is, and what I hope you understand
Is despite all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn’t been easy for us to talk with everyone being around,
But this is.. this is personal, this is for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And I know the seasons may change,
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
But I’m under this umbrella and I’m calling your name
And you know I don’t wanna lose that
I still believe in us
I still believe in love
I still believe in us
I hope you believe in love
The way I believe in us.
You don’t see, is what you don’t see, is when I don’t sleep, I wanna talk to ya
And if I had the world in my hands I’d give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feelin’ the way that I’m feelin’
I wanna know if you feelin’.. the way that I, the way that i
You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart
Be careful with your heart.
