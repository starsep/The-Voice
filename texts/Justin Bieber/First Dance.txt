I close my eyes, I see me and you at the prom, we've both been waiting so long for this day to come, now that it's here
let's make it special.(I'm here tonight) There's so many thoughts on my mind, the dj's playin' my favourite song
(favourite song) no chaperones (no chaperones), this could be the night of your dreams.

Only if you give, give the first dance to me. Girl,I promise i'll be gentle and we gotta do it slowly.
If you give, give the first dance to me. I'm gon' cherish every moment, this only happens once, once in a lifetime.

I couldn't ask for more, we're rockin' back and forth under the disco ball, we're the only ones on the floor.
(I'm here tonight) There's so many thoughts on my mind, the dj's playin' my favourite song (favourite song) now i'm all alone
(all alone) here's the opportunity

Only if you give, give the first dance to me. Girl,I promise i'll be gentle and we gotta do it slowly.
If you give, give the first dance to me. I'm gon' cherish every moment, this only happens once, once in a lifetime.

everybody says that we look cute together, let's make this a night the two of us remember. No teachers around
to see us dancing close, i'm telling you our parents will never know.Before the lights go up and the music turns off
that's the perfect time for me taste your lip gloss.Your glass slippers and my hand right here, we'll make it before the
clock strikes nine

Only if you give, give the first dance to me. Girl,I promise i'll be gentle and we gotta do it slowly.
If you give, give the first dance to me. I'm gon' cherish every moment, this only happens once, once in a lifetime.
