Speaking in tongues, yabba dabba dabba da da
Volia, I’m killin’ this … caca
Call up Lady Gaga, on my, on my telephone
Hella dome, yeah, my girl beats, no metronome
My new chick, she a yellowbone
I buy her yellow stones, ’cause I like it when she got that yellow on
So I’m a raptor, tearin’ it up like a tractor
Matter fact, I’m killin’ this track, you’re a slacker
Sack like a sacker, hello Mr. Brady
Tell ‘im leave his hair to the guy who sings “Baby”
Baby, come and try to save me
Lately, I’ve been hearing these things that sound crazy
Like

[Speaking in tongues]

All right, stop, drop and roll, Justin Bieber is on fire
It’s time to realize it’s time to call me Young Sire
You’re the seller, I’m the buyer
You’re the teller, and I’m hired
I’m higher than the highest point, yes, I am flyer
And I’m wired to the game, stay dry when it rains
I’m tired of the fame, are you proud of the pain?
Yes, we’re the same, yes, I’m insane
And my mane hangs down, I’m a puppet, got strings

I murdered that, mayne
Shawty Mane!
Shawty Mane, what you doin’, Shawty Mane?

I’m Justin Bieber
You guys might know me as the guy who sings “Baby”
You know, uh, I’m a singer, pop singer
I’m white [I’m white, I’m white]
But, um, you know
I just wanted to do this
Just to prove that, you know
I got skills, on, on, on the rap game
So, yeah
What up Jewel Keys?
Yo, I killed that
All right, peace
