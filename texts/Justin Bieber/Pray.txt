Ohh Ohh Ohh....and I pray..

I just cant sleep tonight.
Knowing that things aint right.
It's in the papers, it's on the tv, it's everywhere that I go.

Childrens are crying.
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home
But I know there's sunshine behind that rain

I know there's good times behind that pain,
hey...Can you tell me how I can make a change.

Ref:

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite, knowing kids starve tonight.
And when I sit up, cause saw my dinner is still on my plate.
Ooo...I got a vision, to make a difference.
And its starting today.

Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain,
Haven't tell me how I can make a change.

Ref:

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day

I close my eyes and...
I pray for the broken-hearted.
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lose not breathing.
I pray for all the souls in need I pray...
Can you give em one today.

I just cant sleep tonight
Can someone tell how to make a change?

Ref:

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and...

I pray... I pray... I pray

I close my eyes and pray...
