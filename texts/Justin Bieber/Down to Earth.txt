I never thought that it'll be easy
Cause we both so distance now
And the walls are closing in noneless 
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tells me apart

So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry (and cry and cry and cry)
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
(Back down to earth x8)

Mommy you'll always somewhere
And daddy I live out of town
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow ?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears 
Whoa so far away and now I just need you here

So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry (and cry and cry and cry)
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
(Back down to earth x8)

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and were do we go
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth

I never thought that it'll be easy
Cause we both so distance now
And the walls are closing in noneless
And we're wondering how
