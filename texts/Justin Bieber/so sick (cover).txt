gotta change my answering machine now that im alone
zuz right now it says that we
cant come to the phone
and I know it makes no sence
cuz you walked out the door
but its the only way i hear your voice anymore
( its ridiculous )
its been months
and for some reason i just
( cant get over us )
and im stronger then this
( enough is enough )
no more walkin round
with my head down
im so over being blue
cryin over you

and im so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing you were still here
said im so sick of love songs so sad and slow
so why cant i turn off the radio ?

gotta fix that calender i have
thats marked July 15th
because since theres no more you
theres no more anniversary
im so fed up with my thoughts of you
and your memory
and how every song reminds me
of what used to be

thats the reason im so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing you were still here
said im so sick of love songs so sad and slow
so why cant I turn off the radio ?

( leave me alone )
leave me alone
( stupid love songs )
dont make me think about her smile
or having my first child
let it go
turning off the radio

cuz im so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing she was still here
said im so sick of love songs so sad and slow
so why cant i turn off the radio?
( why cant i turn off the radio ? )
