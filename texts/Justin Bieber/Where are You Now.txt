Where are you now
When I need you the most
Why don't you take my hand
I want to be close

Help me when I am down
Lift me up off the ground
Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong

Take my hand and walk with me

I need you to set me free yeah

Where are you now
When nothing is going right
Where are you now
I can't see the light

Where are you noooow,
When I need you the most?

Why don't you take my hand?
I wanna be close.
Take my hand and walk with me, yeahh.

Where are you noooooww,
When nothing's going right?
Where are you nooooww?
I can't see the light.

So take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be, yeah
I need you to set me free, yeahh.

Where are you now?
Now that I'm half-grown.
Why are we far apart?
I feel all alone.

Where are you noooow?
When nothing's going right.
Where are you now?
I can't see the light...
