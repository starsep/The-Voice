Uh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in the light
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time, better believe it

Uh-oh, whenever youre not in my presence
It feels like Im missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
Till you back again, yeah, yeah

You think Im biased
Too much I never get other
You hit it right on the head
Only been missing my lover

Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I dont reply
But the next day bothers you, I

Youre all that matters to me
Yeah yeah, aint worry about nobody else
If it aint you, I aint myself
You make me complete
Youre all that matters to me

Yeah, yeah, whats a king bed without a queen
There aint no I in team
You make me complete
Youre all that matters to me

Take the keys out the car it wont drive
Thats how I feel when youre not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you, and only you

Uh-oh, Im grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
Youre the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart please believe

Youre all that matters to me
Yeah yeah, aint worry about nobody else
If it aint you, I aint myself
You make me complete
Youre all that matters to me

Yeah, yeah, whats a king bed without a queen
There aint no I in team
You make me complete
Youre all that matters to me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Youre all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Youre all that matters to me
