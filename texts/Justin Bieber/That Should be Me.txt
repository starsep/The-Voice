Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumors spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you
did with me
Does he love you the way I can
Did you forget all the plans
that you made with me
'cause baby I didn't


That should be me
Holdin' your hand
That should be me
Makin' you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me
Feelin' your kiss
That should be me
Buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong,
I can't go on,
till you believe that
That should be me


That should be me
Yeah,
You said you needed a little time
for my mistakes
It's funny how you use that time
to have me replaced
But did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
Whatcha doin' to me
you're taken' him where we used to go
Now if you're tryin' to break my heart
it's working 'cause you know that

Chorus:

That should be me
Holdin' your hand
That should be me
Makin' you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me
Feelin' your kiss
That should be me
buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong,
I can't go on,
till you believe that
That should be me

I need to know should I fight
for our love for this long
It's getting harder to shield
this pain in my heart

Chorus:
That should be me
Holdin' your hand
That should be me
Makin' you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me
Feelin' your kiss
That should be me
Buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong,
I can't go on,
Till you believe that
That should be me

That should be me
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me
