First I’ll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Just tryna make it right.

Make it right (x3)
It's time to do you right

Missing your good intentions
Missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same

I know that I caused a problem
Know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away

Learned it don’t pay to lie
Costs more to see you cry
Saying nothing gets you nowhere fast
I’ma hold it back inside

Well now that I’m back around you
Nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same

First, I’ll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Just tryna make it right.

Make it Right (x3)
It's ime to do you right

Going through all the motions
Trying to find a reason
Why we ended that way

Nothing in life is perfect
When you're changing like the seasons
That’s what they used to say

Cause going to sleep alone at night
I don’t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give
No more holding back this time

Now that i’m back around you,
Nothing around me matters
Hope you feel the same

First, I’ll acknowledge
Your trust has been broken now
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
And tryna make it right.

Make it right (make it right, make it right) (x3)
This time i’ll do you right

You know I’ma do you right (x4)
I’ma do you right
You know I’ma do you right
