yeah I got a PHD
I don’t need a fake ID
yeah,you females know of me
I’m so sick with no IV
J U S I T
Bieber Fever in the Streets
Touch and realize
I’m a beast
I’m a beast
I’m a beast

See the girls
They know I’m right
Through the night
I know that it’s curable
It’s curable
But it’s alright

See the man across the globe
Been to every single home
Every city, every country
Every girl is on the phone

(Oh my Gosh, I love him!)
(Isn’ he perfect?)

You can be my queen, yeah
I’ll show you how I work it
How I work it
How I, how I work it
How I work it
How I, how I work it

This is not a cold
Not a flu
Not a sickness
Baby, this is good
And doesn’t hurt to get this

You were never cured
And you never will regret this
Yeah, my swag’s up
Ridin’ with Kenny in the Lexis

(Oh my God!)
(It’s Bieber Fever!)
(It’s everywhere!)

(That’s why we called it.. Bieber Fever!)

[Chorus x3]
Dr. Bieber
Doc doc Dr. Bieber

Doc doc Dr. Bieber
Cure the fever,
Cur cur cure the fever
Cur Cure the fever,
