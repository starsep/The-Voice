Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infend so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night.
Son of God, loves pure light
Radiant beans from thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus lord at thy birth
Jesus lord at thy birth.
