[Intro]
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright,
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright,

Say you love me
As much as I love you yeah
Would you hurt me baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me baby?
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy
Leave my heart still at the door?

Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is...

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oooh, it feels so right
So baby baby please don't stop girl

(Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright) [X2]

Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy
It sure is worth a try

Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules baby?
If this a lesson
Baby teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you

Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is...

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oooh, it feels so right
So baby baby please don't stop girl

Basically I'm saying here
I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me yeah
Ain't no need for contemplating
Promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me baby, I'm all that you need

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oooh, it feels so right
So baby baby please don't stop girl

If I could die in your arms
Imma make you believe girl
That I wouldn't mind
Eh eh eh, oh
