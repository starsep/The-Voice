Oooh noo
Ohh noo
Ooh

Thay say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love
(Of love, of love)
Before they outlaw the kiss, baby give me one last hug
(Last hug, last hug)
Theres a dream, that I've been chasing 
Want so badly, for it to be reality
(Reality, reality)
And when you hold my hand, then I understand that it's meant to be
'Cause baby when you're with me..

ref.
It's like an angel came by and took me to Heaven
(Like you took me to Heaven, girl)
'Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
(I don't want you to go, oooh no, Soo)

Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
'Cause this life's too long, and this love's too strong
So baby know for sure,
That I'll never let you go

I got my favorite girl
Not feeling, no pain, no fear
(No fear, no fear)
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here?
(Are here, are here)
Theres a moment I've been chasing 
And I finally caught it out on this floor
(This floor, this floor)
Baby theres no hesitation, no reservation
By taking a chance and more
Ohh no, because
