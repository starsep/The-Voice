As long as you love me x 3

I'm under pressure, seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together, smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, don't know girl, we both know what to do
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me, we could be starving,
We could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be
Your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me x 2

I'll be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for the change girl
I'll be your Hova, you can be my Destiny's Child on a stinger
So don't stress, don't cry, oh we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

As you love me we could be starving,
We could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be
Your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me x2


I don't make if this make sense
You're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendez-vous
I'll fly it to ya, I'll meet you there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without you
No we on top of the world
Cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit
Now the skies are point of view
Now we stepping out like woah
Cameras point at you, ask me what's best side
I'll stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with,
Feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's greener where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby, true true true
But I rather work on this with you
Than then go ahead and start with someone new

As you love me we could be starving
We could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be
Your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me x5
