You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love
When you was just a young'un you're looks but so precious
But now your grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, How to love
//Justin Rapping//
Uh...
I just want to take my time
I just want to do my thing
Maybe we press rewind
Maybe I buy that ring
We could grow old together
Just share our souls together
Find how to love, kiss and hug
How to roll together
I just need you by my side
Maybe we could be alright
I just want to hold you right
We can go into the night
You're the one I need.

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, Had a love
2x
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault
Wasn't in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You don't wanna listen
But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad, Nobody else trippin
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

See You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, Had a love
I just want you to know,
Yeahh, Ooh yeahh
