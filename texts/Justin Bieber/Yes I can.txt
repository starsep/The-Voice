Lock me up, sock me up,
Bring me to the tops and up
Put me up in change.
Cause the beast feel the beast
Feel no paint
Yo Iâ€™m not little lil wayne
And I aint no T-pain
My swaggers like BAM
And my flow is insane
Im like Lebron James
Yo, I gotta make my name,
They call me great dane
Cause my side made up me
What I trying to say is,
Give ahead give ahead
For those man in iran
You can You can do it to.
Just say yes I can.
If your livin on the streets
Just say yes I can
If you struggiling to eat
Just say yes I can,
and if you haven't seen your kids for weeks just say
YES YOU CAN!
