Oooh ...aa .. Oooh .. aaaa .. Oooh .. aaaa .. 

You know you love me
I know you care
Just shout whenever
And i'll be there
You want my love
You want my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item?
Girl quit playin'
We're just friends,
What are you saying
Said theres another
Look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time

And i was like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo,
like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine,
Baby, baby, baby ooooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo
like baby, baby, baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine,

OOh for you i would've done whatever
And i just can't believe we ain't together
And i wanna play it cool
But I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything
I'll buy you any ring
And i'm in pieces
Baby, fix me
And you shake me till you wake me From this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down

And i just can't believe my first love won't be around

And i'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo,
like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine,
Baby, baby, baby ooooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo
like baby, baby, baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine,

Ludacris:

When i was 13, i had my first love
there was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody ever came beetwen us
Or could ever come above She had me going crazy
Oh, i was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound
It skips a beat when i see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But i really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing
cus she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking
But i just keep on saying


Baby, baby, baby oooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo,
like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine
Baby, baby, baby ooooh
like baby, baby, baby nooo
like baby, baby, baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine

Now i'm all gone
yeah,yeah

yeah, yeah
Now i'm all gone
