Just a fraction of your love 
fills the air,
And I fall in love with you,
All over again,
Ooh,
You're the light that faced the sun,
In my world,
I'd face a thousand years of pain
For my girl.

Out of all the things in life,
That I could fear,
The only thing that would hurt me,
Is if you weren't here,
Woah

I don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?

Girl with out you I'm lost
Can't face this focus at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator, oh, oh, ohh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator, oh, oh, ohh, oh, oh

Before your love was low
Now you're just my height, aye
We chase the game that would put
My cot in the side

Broken heart rise up to say
Love is alive
You and I would stand
To be multiplied, yeah

Out of all the things in life,
That I could fear,
Uh
The only thing that would hurt me,
Is if you weren't here, here, here
Yeah

I don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?

Girl with out you I'm lost
Can't face this focus at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator, oh, oh, ohh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator, oh, oh, ohh, oh, oh

I'm never ever not,
Without your touch,
Every kiss that you give,
It gives me heart,
And to all the heart it can,
Jealous females hate it,
I'ma hold it down for you,

For you, woah, oh woah,
Common denominator,
Oh, yeah, woahh,
I don't wanna to go back,
Half of the equation, woah woah yeah,
Common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Common denominator
Oh, oh, ohh, oh, oh

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I'd fall in love with you all over again
