Yeah, welcome to tha Church, Volume II
Exclusive 213
Got my nephew Nate Dogg in da house
Nate Dogg holla at 'em, where you at?

Ridin' in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke

You were reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know

She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said, "I'll soon be home"
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying for, why? 'Cuz I'm fly

Yeah, he super sly, Nate Dogg
Ohh ohh ohh I'm fly, yeah
You know he supa sly
But me I'm supa dupa and I'm supa dupa fly

I'd be the great at this I know you waited this
And I wanted this to be elaborate and so strenuous
And then you just slide by and wiz-ave
You on another piz-age, is that the way you gon' be-hiz-ave?

I know you're feeling all hurt inside
But won't you talk to a playa? Let me help out your pride
I'm like a counselor, a pastor, a priest or a physchologist
A shrink, on a freak, peep my technique

And I wear minks, gator boots
And I'm the rip that gets the loot
And I ain't afraid to shoot
And I love to toot toot

Beep beep as I slide up the street
I'm from the LBC and I don't know what y'all done heard about me
But I'm a C-R-I-P with some P-I-M-P too
I'm a real pimp playa from the 213 crew

Now look here boo
If you gonna bang or hang with tha Dogg
You best to get in
Holla at her Nate Dogg

Ridin' in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke

You were reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know

She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said, "I'll soon be home"
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying fo', why? 'Cuz I'm fly

Yeah, he super sly, Nate Dogg
Ohh ohh ohh I'm fly, yeah

Warren G, 3 piece with a mink
Gotta think my shit stinks
Stacy Adams with a drink
Pockets pad up, they come from Brinks

So what the ladies wink
You the one in the Mercedes
Shotgun with the thing
Coat chillin' watchin', "The Lion King"

Crying and thangs
'Cuz I'm with Snoop and Nate, singing, rhyming and things
I'm out late 'cuz I'm rhyming for change
I ain't with dime for dames

Hop back and I'm trying to aim
At everything, that be hating my fame
Since regulatin', been lacing the game
Ain't no mistake in the game

Two-one mother f'in dwizzle sippin' on the sizzle
And that's for shizzle
Four times for da riddles
You know these bars

Everywhere we go, you know who us are
You could tell by the car
Champagne caviar
Bubble bath, I say I love you and I laugh

Ridin' in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke

You were reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know

She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said, "I'll soon be home"
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying fo', why? 'Cuz I'm fly

Yeah he super sly, Nate Dogg
Ohh ohh ohh I'm fly, yeah
