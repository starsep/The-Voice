And the sandfall, stormy day, it’s a destroyer, this is for you

Whenever do I ever do I ever want this to phase me 
Whenever do I ever do I want this thing to make me 
Cause the fame and the money and the girls will drive you crazy

Let the rest do the work and I’m sure that I’ll be fine 

When the wind blows and the sun goes away
