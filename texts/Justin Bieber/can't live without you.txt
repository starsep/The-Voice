I just sit here waiting for you to call
And then I wonder if you're even calling at all
So many thoughts in my mind
Wishing you could be here all the time

Cause Im lost without you 
And I cant just doubt you
And theres everything about you
I just cant live without you
Cause Im lost without you 
And I cant just doubt you
And theres everything about you
I just cant live without you
