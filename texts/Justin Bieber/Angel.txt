Spend all your time waiting for that second chance,
for the break that would make it okay.
There's alway some reason to feel not good enough,
and it's hard at the end of the day...
I need some distraction- oh, beautiful release...
Memory seeps from my veins.
Let me be empty,
and weightless, and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight.

In the arms of the angel,
fly away from here...
From this dark, cold hotel room,
and the endlessness that you fear...

You are pulled from the wreckage
of your silent reverie...
You're in the arms of the angel-
may you find some comfort there...

So tired of the straight line,
and everywhere you turn,
there's vultures and
thieves at your back.
And the storm keeps on twisting,
keep on building the lies that you make up for all
that you lack...
Don't make no difference...
Escaping one last time...
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness, oh,
this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees...

In the arms of the angel,
fly away from here...
From this dark, cold hotel room,
and the endlessness that you fear...

You are pulled from the wreckage
of your silent reverie...
You're in the arms of the angel-
may you find some comfort there...

You're in the arms of the angel-
may you find some comfort there...
