It's a holiday
Spend it with you baby
I think that I am in love this Christmas, yeah
Just hang your stockings on the fireplace
You know that santa's coming to town
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh, right now

So today is all about you babe
The mistletoe can pull us closer
It's what I'm waiting for
It sorta feels like it's valentine's, valentine's

So in on top of your roof
Them sleigh bells is ringing
I'll be up all night with you
Don't care what they're saying
Jspsn to Peru, baby me and you
This christmas eve

Be my date this christmas eve
Be my holiday, my dream
(Lay your head on me)
I got you babe

Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl
You're everything I need
Let me give you all of me
Together on this christmas eve

You leave some cookies out,
I'ma eat 'em up
Nobody can see me but you
It's so magical

When we use imagination,
We can fly to never neverland
To north pole, ain't that cold
If you wanna go
I got you baby

Be my date this christmas eve
Be my holiday, my dream
(Lay your head on me)
I got you babe

Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl
You're everything I need
Let me give you all of me
Together on this christmas eve

Be my, be my, christmas eve
Be my, be my, christmas christmas
Be my, be my, christmas eve
I promise I won't do you wrong

Be my date this christmas eve
Be my holiday, my dream
(Lay your head on me)
I got you babe

Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl
You're everything I need
Let me give you all of me
Together on this christmas eve

Be my, be my, christmas eve
Be my, be my, christmas eve
Be my, be my, christmas eve
