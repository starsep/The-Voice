It feels like we've been out at sea, whoa
So back and forth that's how it seems, whoa
And when I wanna talk you say to me
That if it's meant to be it will be
Whoa oh no
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you
Got me out here in the water
And I

I'm overboard
And I need your love
Pull me up
I can't swim on my own
It's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me
My lifesaver
(Lifesaver, oh lifesaver)
My lifesaver
(Lifesaver, oh lifesaver)
Whoa

(Justin)
I never understood you when you'd say, whoa
Wanted me to meet you halfway, whoa
Felt like I was doing my part
You kept thinking you were coming up short
It's funny how things change cause now I see
Oh whoa
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you
Got me out here in the water
And I

I'm overboard (overboard)
And I need your love
Pull me up (Pull me up)
I can't swim on my own
It's too much (it's too much)
Feels like I'm drowning (ohh)
Without your love
So throw yourself out to me
My lifesaver

(Justin &amp; Jessica)
Oh
It's supposed to be some give and take I know
But you're only taking and not giving anymore
So what do I do
Cause I still love you
(I still love you baby)
And you're the only one who can save me

Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh

I'm overboard
And I need your love
Pull me up
(Pull me up)
I can't swim on my own
It's too much (it's too much)
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
(I'm drowning baby, I'm drowning)
So throw yourself out to me
(I can't swim)
My lifesaver

(Lifesaver, oh lifesaver)
My lifesaver
It's crazy crazy crazy
