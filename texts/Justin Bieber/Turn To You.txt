You worked two jobs,
To keep a roof above our heads,
You chose a life for me,
No you never gave up,
I admire you for the strength you've instilled in me,
You were so young
You were just my age when you had me mom,
You were so brave.
There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way.
And I know you will always be there for me.

So when you're lost and you're tired,
When you're broken in two,
Let my love take you higher, cause I, I still turn to you.
I still turn to you, I still turn to you.

It was '94, the year that
Everything started to change from before
You had to be a woman,
You were forced to change your ways, to change your ways...
Then you found the Lord,
You gave your life to Him,
And you could not ignore, the love he had for you
And I wanted more of your heart.

So when you're lost and you're tired,
When you're broken in two,
Let my love take you higher,
Cause I, I still turn to you.
I still turn to you, I still turn to you.

I don't know what I'd if you left me,
So please don't go away,
Everything that you are is who I am, who I am today...

So when you're lost (you're Lost) and you're tired, (you're tired)
When you're broken in two, (In two)
Let my love take you higher, (You higher)
Cause I, (I) I still turn to you.
I still turn to you, I still turn to you.

To you, to you, to you.
I still turn to you.
(I still turn to you)
Cause I, I turn to you.
