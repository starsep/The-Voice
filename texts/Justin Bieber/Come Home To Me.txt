Come Home to me 
Come Home to me
Back into my arms 
Home where you belong
Come Home to me 
Come home to me 
If home is where you are 
Home is way too far away 

The TV light of blue and white 
I just can’t fall asleep at night 
and I move to a space where you should be

Ever halfway seems so far 
Over mountains and diamond stars
Everybody has their own way home

Come Home to me 
Come Home to me
Back into my arms 
Home where you belong
Come Home to me 
Come home to me 
If home is where you are 
Then Home is way too far away 

All my life I've dreamed of love 
Never thought it would hurt this much 
To kiss goodbye and wait for your return
So I’II be strong and hold on to 
The picture and the thought of you 
Getting all the love that you deserve.

Come Home to me 
Come Home to me
Back into my arms 
Home where you belong
Come Home to me 
Come home to me 
If home is where you are 
Then Home is way too far away 

If home is where you are 
Then Home is way too far away.
