No I didn’t think
You would let me down that easy 
Oh no, girl

And I didn’t think
It was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing baby

In that moment was so hard for me to breathe 
You just took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life is so unpredictable, yeah
Never thought a love like yours 
Would leave me all alone
Oh no

You didn’t waste any time
Like you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
Cause I was out of line
Oh yeah

But I didn’t think
You’d let me down that easy
Oh, no girl

And I didn’t think
It was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, girl

It was a Bad Day

Hey, hey, hey yeah
I know I was wrong
But you could have said goodbye baby

It was a Bad Day
Now I’m like woah

It was a Bad Day (x3)
