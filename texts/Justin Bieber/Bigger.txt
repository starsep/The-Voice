her love , her love is , Bigger
Bigger


gotta belive in me
belive in like a fairytale
if you show me your favorite places
before i wont , i wont .
have i ever let you down
like a see - saw its down 
you know why 
cos we aint in the playground
no more games were

were big enough
to stand in the picture
were big enough
to stand next rides

i was a player , when i was little
now im bigger , im bigger
a heartbreaker , when i was little
bit im bigger , im bigger
all the hearts , i swear
they look so small from up here
cos were bigger
alot bigger
im bigger , your bigger

( whooaa )

i remember when my heart was young
was still bigger than me
is that the reason why you stayed
or else you would of got rid of me 
( hey )
now the bullies in my school yard
cant take a hug without kisses from us
( whoa )
but they pushovers , no more games
were ..
big enough
to stand in the picture
big enough

i was a player , when i was little
now im bigger , im bigger
a heartbreaker , when i was little
but im bigger , im bigger
all the haters , i swear
they look so small from up here
cos were bigger

is the love falling down
