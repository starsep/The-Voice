There's a dream in my soul
A fire deep inside of me
There's me,
No one knows
Waiting to be set free.
I'm gonna see that day
I can feel it
I can taste it.
Change is coming my way.

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me.
I light up the sky sky like lightening,
I'm gonna rise above
Show em what I made of.
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
This world will belong to me.

This life can make you debase
This world can make you feel small.
They will not give me down
I was born to stand some.

I'll go another way. 
I can feel it 
I believe it
I'm here 
I'm here to stay

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me.
I light up the sky sky like lightening,
I'm gonna rise above
Show em what I made of.
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
This world will belong to me.

Feel it
Believe it
Dram it
Be it!

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me.
I light up the sky sky like lightening,
I'm gonna rise above
Show em what I made of.
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
This world will belong to me.
ooh oh ooh oh
This world will belong to me...
