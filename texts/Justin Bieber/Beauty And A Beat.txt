Young Money, Nicki Minaj, Justin

Show you off, tonight I wanna show you off
What you got, a billion could've never bought
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, be young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all by you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do
Cause...

[Beat break]

Body rock, girl, I can feel your body rock
Take a bow, you on the hottest ticket now
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, be young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all by you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do

[Nicki Minaj]
In time, ink lines, bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tour, it's mine, ten little letters, on a big sign
Justin bieber, you know I'mma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, weiner, but I gotta keep my eye out for Selener
Beauty, beauty and the beat
Beauty from the east, beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets, we don't get deceased
Every time a beauty on the beats
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, Let's go, Let's go)

Body rock, girl, I wanna feel your body rock
Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all by you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do
Cause...
