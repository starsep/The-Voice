I could go back to every laugh
But i don't want to go there anymore
And i know all the steps up to your door
But i don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind
Talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I leave my window open
Cuz i'm too tired not to call your name
Just know i'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But i don't want to have to go that far
And i, i got you down
I know you by heart
And you dont' even know where i start

Talk to yourself
Talk to the teams
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I leave my window open
Cuz i'm too tired not to call your name
Just know i'm right here hoping
You'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long
Scream your name
I dont' know where as i can see

But i leave my window open
Cuz i'm too tired not ....?
Just know i'm right here hoping
You'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But i don't wanna go there anymore
