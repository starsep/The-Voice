It feels like a perfect night 
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah, ah. ah,ah
It feels like a perfect night 
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah, ah. ah,ah

Yeah, we’re happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It’s miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight’s the night when we forget about the deadlines, it’s time

Uh-oh, 
I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if 
You keep me next to you
You don’t know about me 
But I’ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if 
We just keep dancing like we’re... twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights 
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Ah, ah. ah,ah (Who’s Taylor Swift anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene.
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping,

Yeah..
We’re happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It’s miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight’s the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It’s time

Uh-oh
I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling twenty-two.
Everything will be alright if 
You keep me next to you
You don’t know about me 
But I’ll bet you want to.
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we’re... twenty-two, twenty-two
I don’t know about you
twenty-two, twenty-two

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won’t be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you 
I gotta have you

I don’t know about you
(I don't know about you)
But I’m feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright
(Uuuuuuh)
If you keep me next to you
You don’t know about me 
(You don’t know about me)
But I’ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if 
We just keep dancing like we’re... twenty-two, twenty-two, twenty-two, yeah, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won’t be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
