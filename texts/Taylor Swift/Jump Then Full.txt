i like the way you sound in the morning
we are on the phone and without a warning
i realize your laugh is the best sound 
i have ever heard
i like the way i cant keep my focus
i watch you talk
you didn't notice
i hear the words but all i can think is 
we should be together

every time you smile, i smile
and every time you shine,
i'll shine for you

im feeling you baby 
dont be afraid to
jump then fall
jump then fall Into me

be there never gonna leave you
see that you want to be with me too
so i stay through it all 
so jump then fall

i like the way your hair falls in your face
you got the keys to me
i love each freak on your face
ive never been so wrapped up
honey i like the way youre everything i ever wanted
i had time to think it over
and all i can say is come closer
take a deep breath 
and jump then fall into me

cuz every time you smile, i smile
and every time you shine,
i'll shine for you.

im feeling you baby 
dont be afraid to
jump then fall
jump then fall Into me

be there never gonna leave you
see that you want to be with me too
so i stay through it all 
so jump then fall 

the bottoms gonna drop 
out from under our feet
ill catch you
ill catch you

and people say things 
that bring you to your knees
ill catch you
the time is gonna come 
when youre so mad you could cry
but ill hold you through 
the night until you smile

i need you baby
dont be afraid please 
jump then fall
jump then fall into me

be there never gonna leave you
see that you want to be with me too
so i stay through it all so 
jump then fall.
jump then fall baby
jump then fall
Into me
Into me

every time you smile, i smile
and every time you shine, i shine
and every time youre here
baby ill show you
ill show you, you can
jump then fall
jump then fall
jump then fall
into me
