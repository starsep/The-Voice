I Heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space
Every room
And i know, yeah
If I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes will you be there?

I don't wanna lose your face
I dont wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
I dont wanna turn around
'Cause Im not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I dont wanna lose your face

I've gotta picture of you in my bedroom
And i hope it never falls
I hope I never lose that feelin'
I used to get when you called
And I wonder to myself
Who were you?
Where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

I don't wanna lose your face
I dont wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
I dont wanna turn around
'Cause Im not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I dont wanna lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sun could have your lips
And I had you
Oh oh yeah

I don't wanna lose your face
I dont wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
I dont wanna turn around
'Cause Im not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I dont wanna lose your face
Oh no no

I don't wanna lose your face
And I dont wanna turn around

Oh oh oh
Yeah
oh oh
oh oh
oh oh yeah
