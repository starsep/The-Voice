Here you come again
Just when I'm about to get myself together
You waltz right through the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart around your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And light those dreamy eyes
And pretty soon I'm wonderin'
How I came to doubt you
All you gotta do
Is smile, that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messin' up my mind
And fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body
Has the right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again

All you gotta do
Is smile, that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messin' up my mind
And fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body
Has the right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
Here I go
And here you come again
Here I go
