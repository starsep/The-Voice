Say you're sorry-- 
That face of an angel 
comes out just when you need it to. 
As I paced back and forth all this time 
'cause I honestly believed in you. 
Holdin' on, 
the days drag on. 
Stupid girl, 
I should've known, I should've known. 

(( Chorus )) 
That I'm not a princess; this ain't a fairy tale. 
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, 
lead her up the stairwell. 
This ain't Hollywood; this is a small town. 
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down. 
Now it too late for you and your white horse to come around. 

Maybe I was naive, 
got lost in your eyes and never really had a chance. 
My mistake I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me: 
happy endings. 
Now I know 

(( Chorus )) 
That I'm not a princess; this ain't a fairy tale. 
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, 
lead her up the stairwell. 
This ain't Hollywood; this is a small town. 
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down. 
Now it too late for you and your white horse to come around. 

And there you are on your knees-- 
begging for forgiveness, begging for me 
just like I always wanted, but I'm sooo sorry. 

'Cause I'm not your princess; this ain't a fairytale. 
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well. 
This is a big world; that was a small town, 
there in my rearview mirror disappearing now. 
And it's too late for you and your white horse-- 
now it's too late for you and your white hrose to catch me now. 
Oh whoa whoa whoaaa try and catch me now. 
Ooh it's too late to catch me now.
