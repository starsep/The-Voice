Now that he's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey
Acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time a to change, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey
But since his return from his stay on the moon
He listens like spring and she talks like June, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey

But tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the milky way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Now that he's back from that soul vacation
Tracing his way through the constellation, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey
Now that he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

Tell me did this wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the milky way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone
Conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss my while you were looking for yourself out

Na na na na na na na na na na na aaahh ooohhhooo
Na na na na na na na na na na na aaahh...

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
