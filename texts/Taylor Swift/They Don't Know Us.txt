They don't think our love will last.
They say we're moving much to fast
Just because our love is new.
Doesn't mean it can't be true.
Our love is young and so are we,
I love you and you love me,
But they don't believe us,
Cause' they don't know us,
They don't know us we can see,
They won't listen to you and me,
Instead of trying to change our plans,
Why not give us a helping hand.
Just like Juliette loved romeo,
Sometimes others don't always know.
But they won't help us,
Cause they don't know us.

Chorus

Why not give us a chance and see,
Just how true our love can be,
They know you and they know me,
But they don't know us,
. (music turnaround)
They say we're young and love is blind,
We should give this some more time,

Did they forget they were young like us,
All we ask is a little trust.

We love each other can't they see
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be.
They know you --and they know me,
But they don' know us,
Music intro
I hope soon your folks and mine,
Will get together and take the time,
And get to know us,
Really get to know us.
Why not give us a chance ' and see
Just how strong our love can be.
They know you, and they know me,
But they don't know us.
Ooh woo a woo owho yeah
They don't know us that's for sure,
We're not their little children anymore.
Just because our love is new,
Doesn't mean it can't be true
Why not give us a chance and see,
How true love is suppose to be,
They know you and they know me,
But they don't know us...
Yes they know you and they know me,
But they just don't know us,
