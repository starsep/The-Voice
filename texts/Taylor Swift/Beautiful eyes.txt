Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why
I wanna be somewhere 
Where you are
I wanna be where

You're here
Your eyes are lookin' into mine
So baby make me [collide][fly]
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm lookin' through your
I'm lookin' through your eyes

I wake up I'm alive
In only a little while
I'll cry
'Cause your my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight
'Cause I
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

You're here
Your eyes are lookin' into mine
So baby make me [collide][fly]
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm lookin' through your
I'm lookin' through your eyes

Just as long as your mine
I'll be your everything tonight
[I'd be lucky to][let me love you]kiss you
Baby let me miss you
Let me see your
dream about
dream about
dream about your eyes
eyes
eyes
beautiful eyes
