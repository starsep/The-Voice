If you love me, then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old
But if I can't at least you'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved

Oh, oh

Do you remember the stuppid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
Cause baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me

Sayin' if you love me, then I love you
I swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old
But if I can't at least you'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved

I can still see it, that old little bridge we used to cross
I finally made it, trying to get lost
You would smile that smile and I'd try so hard to forget
Cause of all the little fires that I still haven't put out yet

And if you love me, then I love you
I swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old
But if I can't at least you'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved

Love was all we knew
And faith was growing on the vine
Words were all we knew
And for one summer you were mine

If you love me, then I love you
I swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old
But if I can't at least you'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved
