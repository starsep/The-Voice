I betcha lie awake at night
Tryin' to make up your sweet mind
Wonderin' if you'll ever find 
Just what you want
A hometown number one
Or a california loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Well that's what you thought
And here's what you got

I could be your favorite blue jeans
with the holes in the knees in the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little out of reach
Or the girl livin' next door
I'll be your angel givin' up her wings
If thats what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything
Be you anything

If you want hard to get
If you want...uhhhh
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Someone with a softer side
Either one'll be all right
Just let me know
If this is how it goes

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees in the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
just a little out of reach
Or the girl livin' next door
I'll be your angel givin' up her wings
If thats what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

Its not like I'm giving up who I am for you
But for someone like you its *just* so easy to do

And I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees in the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little out of reach
Or the girl livin' next door
I'll be your angel givin' up her wings
If thats what you need
If thats what you need

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees in the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little out of reach
Or the girl livin' next door
I'll be your angel givin' up her wings
If thats what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything
