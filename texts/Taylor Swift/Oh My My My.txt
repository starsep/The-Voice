She said: I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, the pretty lights

And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growin up and fallin in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said oh my, my, my...

Take me back to the house with the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
You never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh my my my my

Well I was sixteen when suddeny
I wasnt that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights.
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said oh my, my, my

Take me back to the creek those weeks in love
Two AM ridin in your truck
And all I need
Is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very fist fight
The slammin of doors 'stead of kissin goodnight
You stayed outside
Til the morning light
Oh my, my, my, my

A few years head gone and come around
We were sittin at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time
When we walked down the aisle
The whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do
And I did too
Took me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time
You and I


I'll be 87 youll be 89
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh my, my, my...
