We were both young when I first saw you
I've close my eyes And the flashback starts
I’m standing there On a balcony of summer air
See the lights, See the party the ball gowns
I see you make your way through the crowd
You say hello Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don’t go, and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I’ll be waiting all there’s left to do is run
You’ll be the prince and I’ll be the princess
It’s a love story baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quite cause we’d dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Let’s skip this town for a little while
Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
And I was begging you please don’t go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I’ll be waiting all there’s left to do is run
You’ll be the prince I’ll be the princess
It’s a love story baby just say yes

Romeo save me, then try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it’s real,
Don’t be afraid We’ll make it out of this mess
It’s a love story baby just say yes, oh oh,

I got tred of waiting
Wondering if you would ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts to town I said

Romeo save me I’ve been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don’t know what to think
He kneels to the ground and pulled out a ring And said

Marry me Juliet you’ll never have to be alone
I love you and that’s all I really know
I talk to your dad go pick out a white dress
It’s a love story baby just say yes

Cause we were both young when I first saw you
