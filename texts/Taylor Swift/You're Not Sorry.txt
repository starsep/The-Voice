All this time I was wasting, hoping you would come around
I've been givin' out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And its taken me this long baby but I figured you out
And you think it would be fine again but not this ti-ime around

CHORUS:
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore

And you can say that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby,
Like I did before
You're not sorry. Oh-h-h no. No. No.

Looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waitin' in the cold
And you got your secrets and I'm tired of being last to know-ow
And now you're asking me to listen cause its worked each time before

CHORUS:
[But] you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore

And you can [tell me] that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby,
Like I did before
You're not sorry. No, no. Oh-h-hh-hh.
You're not sorry. No, no. Oh-h-hh-hh.

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would have gone away no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade.

CHORUS:
[So] you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for

And you can say that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby,
Like I did before
You're not sorry. No, no. Oh-h-hh-hh.
You're not sorry. No, no. Oh-h-hh-hh.
