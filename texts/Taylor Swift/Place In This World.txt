I don't know what I want
So don't ask me 'cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking, trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one who feels the way I do

I'm alone, on my own and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve,
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Can you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery
Oh, yeah, but that's okay.

I'm alone, on my own, that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission,
But I'm ready to fly!

I'm alone, on my own and that's all I know
Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on.

Oh, I'm alone, on my own and that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world.

Oooh, I'm just a girl, oh, I'm just a girl, ah um
Oh, I'm just a girl
