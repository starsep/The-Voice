Something 'bout the way 
The street looks when it's 
Just rained. 
There's a glow 
Off the pavement. 
Walk me to car. 
And you know, 
I wanna ask you to dance right there, 
In the middle of the parking lot. 
Yeah. 

I'm driving down the road. 
I wonder if you know. 
Trying so hard, 
Not to get caught up, 
Now. 
You're just so cool, 
Run your hands through your hair. 
Absent mindedly, 
Making me want you. 


CHORUS 
And I don't know how it gets better than this. 
You take my hand, 
And drag me head first, 
Fearless. 
And I don't know why, 
But, with you I'd dance, 
In a storm, 
In my best dress, 
Fearless. 

So baby drive slow, 
Till we run outta road. 
In this one-horse town, 
I wanna stay right here, 
In this passenger seat, 
You put your eyes on me. 
In this moment now, 
Capture every memory. 

CHORUS 
And I don't know how it gets better than this. 
You take my hand, 
And drag me head first, 
Fearless. 
And I don't know why, 
But, with you I'd dance, 
In a storm, 
In my best dress, 
Fearless. 

Well you stood there with me, 
In the doorway. 
My hands shake, 
I'm not usually this way but, 
You pull me in, 
And I'm a little more brave. 
It's the first kiss. 
It's flawless. 
It's really something. 
It's fearless. 

CHORUS 
And I don't know how it gets better than this. 
You take my hand, 
And drag me head first, 
Fearless. 
And I don't know why, 
But, with you I'd dance, 
In a storm, 
In my best dress, 
Fearless. 

And I don't know how it gets better than this. 
You take my hand, 
And drag me head first, 
Fearless. 
And I don't know why, 
But, with you I'll dance, 
In a storm, 
In my best dress, 
Fearless.
