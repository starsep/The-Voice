The way you move is like a full on rainstorm 
and I'm in a house of cards
You say my name for the first time baby, and I
fall in love in an empty bar

And you stood there in front of me 
just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see 
what I was thinking about

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
cause' I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby 
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around 
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

So reach out open handed
and lead me out to that floor 
well I don't need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby bring on the movie star

Cause my heart is beating fast 
and you are beautiful 
I could wait patiently but 
I really wish you would

Drop everything now 
Meet me in the pouring rain 
Kiss me on the sidewalk 
Take away the pain 
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile 

Get me with those green eyes, baby 
As the lights go down 
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around 
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair 
And watch the lights go out 
Just keep your beautiful eyes on me 
Gonna strike this match tonight
Lead me up the staircase 
Won't you whisper soft and slow 
I'd love to hate it
But you make it like a fireworks show

Drop everything now 
Meet me in the pouring rain 
Kiss me on the sidewalk 
Take away the pain 
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile 

Get me with those green eyes, baby 
As the lights go down 
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around 
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
