I like the way you want me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you need me
Every time that things got rocky

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken do you mean
Do you mean what you say
When you say our love couldn't last forever?

But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow, at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time that things got rocky

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken do you say
Do you say what you mean
When you say our love couldn't last forever?

'Cause I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow, at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

You run around and lead me on forever
While I stay at home still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
And I'd rather take a blow, at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Baby don't you break my heart slow
