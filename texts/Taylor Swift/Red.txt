It was a long goodbye,
When you let me go,
I held onto you,
And you kissed me slow
It was burning bright,
We were burning bright
Mm mm mm

We were burning bright,
Our hearts were set on fire
That night, that night
Oh I never will forget
It was burning red, red, red

I'm trying to chase the feeling away
But it keeps on endlessly
Broken hearts they seem familiar,
But that doesn't mean that I'm okay
Oh, can you let me forget it?
But do I want to forget it?
No, no I don't, oh oh

We were burning bright,
Our hearts were set on fire
That night, that night
Oh I never will forget
It was burning red, red, red

We were burning bright,
Our hearts were set on fire
That night, that night
Oh I never will forget
It was burning red, red, red

It was red, red, red
Oh oh oh oh,
You're beautiful
And it was red
Oh oh oh yeah

Red
