Nobody, nobody, will ever love you
The way that i love you
Cause nobody's that strong
Love's bittersweet, life's treasures deep
No one can keep a love that's gone wrong

Nobody, nobody, gonna love you the way i could
Cause nobody's that strong
No nobody's that strong

Nobody, nobody, is gonna love you the way that i love you
Cause nobody is that strong

You've had many lovers, you'll have many others
But they'll only just break your poor heart in two
And nobody, nobody, will love you the way i could
Cause nobody's that strong, no nobody's that strong
