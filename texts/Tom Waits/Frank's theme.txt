Dream away the tears in your eyes
Dream away your sorrows
Dream away all your goodbyes
Dream away tomorrow
I promise when the sun comes up
I promise I'll be true
And just like before the band starts to play
They always play your favorite tune
And dream away when everyone's gone
Dream away your grey skies to
Dream away and nothing is wrong
Dreams have wishes that are waiting for you
And up ahead the road is turning
Turning for you and me
And just like before
The band starts to play
Now there's that twinkle in your eye
And dream away
