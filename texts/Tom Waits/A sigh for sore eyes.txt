Hey sight for sore eyes it's a long time no see
Workin hard hardly workin hey man you know me
Water under the bridge didya see my new car
Well it's bought and it's payed for parked outside of the bar

And hey barkeeper what's keepin you keep pourin drinks
For all these palookas hey you know what i thinks
That we toast to the old days and dimagio too
And old drysdale and mantle whitey ford and to you

No the old gang ain't around everyone has left town
'cept for thumm and giardina said they just might be down
Oh half drunk all the time and i'm all drunk the rest
Yea monk's till the champion but i'm the best

I guess you heard about nash he was killed in a crash
Hell that must of been two or three years ago now
Yea he spun out and he rolled he hit a telephone pole
And he died with the radio on
No she's married and with a kid finally split up with sid
He's up north for a nickle's worth for armed robbery

Hey i'll play you some pin ball hell you ain't got a chance
Well then go on over and ask her to dance
