It's dreamy weather
Where on you waved your crooked wand
Along an icy pond
With a frozen moon
Murder of silhouette crows
I saw in the tears on my face
And the skates on the pond
They spelled Alice
I disappear in your name
But you must wait for me
Somewhere beneath the sea
There's a wreck of a ship
Your hair is like meadowgrass on the tide
And the raindrops on my window
And the ice in my drink
Baby all I can think of is Alice
Arithme-tic arithme-tock
Turn the hands back on the clock
How does the ocean rock the boat?
How did the razor find my throat?
The only strings that hold me here
Are tangled up around the pier
And so secret kiss
Brings madness with the bliss
And I will think of this
When I'm dead in my grave
Set me adrift and I'm lost in your hair
And I must be insane
To go skating on your name
And by tracing it twice
I fell though the ice of Alice
There's only Alice
