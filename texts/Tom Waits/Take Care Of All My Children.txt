Oh, take care of all of my children
Don't let 'em wander and roam
Oh, take care of all of my children
For I don't know when I'm comin' back home

You can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
Nail a sign on the door
Bright and early Sunday morning with my walking cane
I'm going up to see my Lord

Oh, keep them together at the sundown
Safe from the Devil's hand
You gotta make them a pillow on the hard ground
I'll be goin' up to Beulah land

You can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
And nail a sign on the door
Bright and early Sunday morning with my walking cane
I'm going up to see my Lord

Oh remember you never trust the Devil
Stay clear of Lucifer's hand
Oh and don't let 'em wander in the meadow
Or you'll wind up in the fryin' pan

You can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
And nail a sign on the door
Bright and early Sunday morning with my walking cane
I'm going up to see my Lord

Put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
And nail a sign on the door
Bright and early Sunday morning with my walking cane
I'm going up to see my Lord
