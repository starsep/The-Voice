I knew one day
One, one, two, one, two, three

Well my mama didn’t want me
On the day I was born
I was born without a body
I got nothing but scorn
But I always loved music
All I had was my hands
I dreamed I'd be famous
And I’d work at The Sands

Singing, Tabletop Joe, Tabletop Joe
Now everyone will know
That I'm Tabletop Joe

I had trouble with the pedals
But I had a strong left hand
And I could play Stravinsky
On a baby grand
I said, ‘I’m gonna join the circus
Cause that’s where I belong’
So I went to Coney Island
I was singing this song

Tabletop Joe, Tabletop Joe
Now everyone knows
Yeah I'm Tabletop Joe

They gave me top billing
In the Dreamland show
I had my own orchestra
Starring Tabletop Joe
And the man without a body
Proved everyone wrong
I was rich and I was famous
I was where I belonged, yeah

Tabletop Joe, Tabletop Joe
Now everyone knows, yeah
Tabletop Joe

Take it home boy
