They hung a sign up in our town
"If you live it up, you won't live it down"
So, she left Monte Rio, son
Just like a bullet leaves a gun
With charcoal eyes and Monroe hips
She went and took that California trip
Well, the moon was gold, her hair like wind
She said don't look back just come on Jim

Oh you got to hold on, hold on
You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You gotta hold on

Well, he gave her a dimestore watch
And a ring made from a spoon
Everyone is looking for someone to blame
When you share my bed, you share my name
Well, go ahead and call the cops
You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops
She said baby, I still love you
Sometimes there's nothin left to do

Oh but you got to hold on, hold on
Baby got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You got to hold on

Well, God bless your crooked little heart
St. Louis got the best of me
I miss your broken-china voice
How I wish you were still here with me

Oh, you build it up, you wreck it down
And you burn your mansion to the ground
Oh there's nothing left to keep you here
But when you're falling behind in this big blue world

Oh you got to hold on, hold on
Baby got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You got to hold on

Down by the Riverside motel
It's 10 below and falling
By a 99 cent store
She closed her eyes and started swaying
But it's so hard to dance that way
When it's cold and there's no music
Oh your old hometown so far away
But, inside your head there's a record that's playing
A song called

Hold on, hold on, baby got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right there, you gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, hold on, baby gotta hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right there, you gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, hold on, baby gotta hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right there, you gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, hold on, baby gotta hold on
And take my hand, I'm standing right there, you gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, you gotta hold on, you gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, you gotta hold on baby, you gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, you gotta hold on
