Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Momma to the well, momma to the well, momma to the well,
Momma to the well, no more
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Momma to the well, momma to the well, momma to the well,
Momma to the well, no more
Ain't goin' down.

I'm a true believer, I'm a true believer, believer
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Momma to the well, momma to the well, momma to the well,
Momma to the well, no more
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down.

If I ever get able, if I ever get able, able, to pay this debt I owe
Ain't goin' down
I ain't goin' down
Momma to the well, momma to the well,
Momma to the well, no more
Ain't goin' down
Momma to the well, momma to the well, momma to the well, momma to the well,
Momma to the well, no more
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down.
