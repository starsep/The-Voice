Down through the ages all of the sages
Say don't spend your wages on love
It's graft and collusion but the intrusion
And proceeding forclosures there's over exposure
Down at the crossroads questions posed
Bridges washed out and the highways closed
Got to have good reason to firmly believe
Love was designed to exploit and deceive
There's an addendum whenever you send 'em
That red ball that beats in your chest you will see
A simple addition keeps with tradition
Don't spend your wages on love
Take any burgh any city or town
Just get on mainstreet and drive all the way down
See love has a graveyard nurtured for those
That fell on their sabres and pay through the nose
Those shovels of shot glass, dig your own hole
Bury whats left of your miserable soul
Down through the ages all of the sages
Say don't spend your wages on love
It's graft and collusion but the intrusion
And proceeding forclosures there's over exposure
Down at the crossroads question is posed
The bridge is washed out and the highways closed
