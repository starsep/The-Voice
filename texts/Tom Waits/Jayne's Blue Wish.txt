The sky holds all our wishes
The dish ran away with the spoon
Chimney smoke ties the roofs to the sky
There's a hole overhead
It's only the moon

Will there ever be a tree
Grown from the seeds I've sown
Life is a path lit only by the light of those I've loved
By the light of those I love

Life's a path lit only by the light of those I've loved
By the light of those I love
