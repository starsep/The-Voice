I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away

The cradle wants a baby
Kitchen wants a pan
The heart wants a certain kind of lover if it can

The ocean wants a sailor
A gun wants a hand
Money wants a spender
And the road wants a man

I turned my face to the highway
I turned my face to the highway
I turned my face to the highway
And I turn my back on you

Devil wants a sinner
Sky wants a bird
Table wants the dinner
And lips want a word

Glass wants the wine
Fist wants to hurt
Clock wants the time
And the shovel wants to work

I turned my face to the highway
I turned my face to the highway
I turned my face to the highway
And I turn my back on you

I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away

Coal wants a miner
Soldier takes a stand
The walls of the prison
Want a solitary man
The window wants a curtain
The plow wants the land
Diamond ring wants to
Fit upon the finger
Of her hand

I turned my face to the highway
I turned my face to the highway
I turned my face to the highway
And I turned my back on you

I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
