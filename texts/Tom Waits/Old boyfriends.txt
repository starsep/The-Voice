Old Boyfriends,
Lost in the pocket of your overcoat,
Like burned out lite bulbs on a Ferris Wheel.

Old Boy friends,
You remember the kinds of cars they drove,
Parking in an orange grove.
He fell in love you see,
With someone that I used to be.

Tho I very seldom think of him,
Nevertheless sometimes a mannequin's
Blue satin dress can make the window
Like a dream
Ah but now those dreams belong to someone else,
Now they talk endlessly
In a drawer where I keep
All my

Old Boyfriends
Remember when you were burning for them?
Why do you keep turning them into
Old Boyfriends?
They look you up when they're in town
To see if they can still burn you down
You fell in love you see
With someone that I used to be

Old Boyfriends
Turn up every time it rains,
Fall out of the pages in a magazine
Old Boyfriends.
Girls fill up the bars every spring,
Not places for remembering.
Old boyfriends
All my old boyfriends
Old boyfriends
