Muriel since you left town the clubs closed down
And there's one more burned out lamppost down on the main street
Down where we used to stroll
And muriel i still hit all the same old haunts
And you follow me wherever i go
And muriel i see you on a saturday night
In a penny arcade with your hair tied back
And the diamond twinkle in your eye
Is the only wedding ring i'll buy you
Muriel

And muriel how many times i've left this town
To hide from your memory
And it haunts me
But i only get as far as the next whiskey bar
I buy another cheap cigar and i'll see you every night
Hey muriel muriel
Hey buddy got a light
