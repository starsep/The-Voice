Clickin' by your house about two forty-five
With Sidewalk sundae strawberry surprise,
I got a cherry popsicle right on time
I got a big stick, mamma, that'll blow your mind

'Cause I'm your ice cream man, I'm a one-man band
I'm your ice cream man, baby, I'll be good to you.

If you missed me in the alley, baby, don't you fret
Come back around and don't forget,
When you're tired and you're hungry and you want something cool,
Got something better than a swimming pool

'Cause I'm your ice cream man, I'm a one-man band
I'm your ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.
'Cause I'm your ice cream man, I'm a one-man band
I'm your ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.

Well if you see me coming, you ain't got no change
Don't worry baby, it can be arranged
Show me you can smile, baby just for me
Fix you with a drumstick, I'll do it for free

'Cause I'm your ice cream man, I'm a one-man band
I'm your ice cream man, and I'll be good to you.
Be good to you, be good to you,
I'm your ice cream man, I'm a one-man band
I'm your ice cream man, and I'll be good to you
I'm your ice cream man, and I'm your ice cream man
I'm your ice cream man, and I'm your ice cream man
I'm your ice cream man, and I'm your ice cream man ...
