As you go out it's independence day;
But instead i'll just pour myself a drink.
It's got to be love, i've never felt this way.
Oh baby, this one's from the heart

The shadows in the road look like a railroad track.
I wonder if he's (ever) really comin' back.
The moon's a yellow stain across the sky.
Oh baby, this one's from the heart

(maybe) and i'll go down to the corner and get a racin' form,
(but) and i should prob'ly wait here by the phone.
And the brakes need adjustment on the convertible
Oh baby, this one's from the heart

The worm is climbin' the other color tree
Robin is back against the wall;
Pour myself a double sympathy
Oh baby, this one's from the heart.

Blondes, brunettes, and redheads put their hammer down
(to put ) don't pound a cold chisel thru my heart.
But they were nothin' but apostrophes.
O baby, this one's from the heart.

I can't tell, is that a siren or a saxophone?
But the roads get so slipp'ry (when it rains)
I love you more than all these words can ever say
Oh baby, this one's from the heart.
