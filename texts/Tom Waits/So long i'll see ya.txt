Mamas in the kitchen, Daddies on the phone
And nobody knows what's going on
But I've got those so long I'll see you cause my Buick's outside waiting blues

Well one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, Tom's gotta go
He's got them so long I'll see you cause my Buick's outside waiting blues

Well bye-bye-bye, well bye-bye-bye
Sing bye-bye Shooby-do-bye-bye
Gotta skeet-skat outta here, skeet-skat outta here

And mamas in the kitchen, daddies on the phone
And nobody knows what's going on
But I've got those so long I'll see you cause my Buick's outside waiting blues

Well Tommy's gotta skeet-skat, skeet-skat outta here
Skeet-skat right outta here
And one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, I gotta go
Cause I've got them
so long I'll see you cause my Buick's outside waiting blues
And skeet-skat outta here, gonna skeet-skat outta here,
Gonna skeet-skatJoutta here, gonna skeet-skat outta here
Got so long I'll see you cause my Buick's outside waiting blues
Gonna skeet-skat outta here, gonna skeet-skat outta here,
Gonna skeet-skatJoutta here, gonna skeet-skat outta here
