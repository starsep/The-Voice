Well I always play Russian Roulette in my head
Seventeen black, Oh twenty-nine red
How far from the gutter
How far from the pew
I'll always remember to forget about you

A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
And my favorite words are goodbye
And my favorite color is red

A long dead soldier looks out from the frame
No one remembers his war, no one remembers his name
Go out to the meadow, scare off all the crows
It does nothing but rain here, nothing will grow

A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
And my favorite words are goodbye
And my favorite color is red
My favorite color is red
My favorite color is red
