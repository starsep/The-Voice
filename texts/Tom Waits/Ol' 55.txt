My time went so quickly, 
I went lickety-splickly out to my old '55
Pulled away slowly, feeling so holy, 
God knows, I was feeling alive.

And now the sun's coming up, 
I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks,
Stars beginning to fade, 
and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,
Oh, Lord, that the feeling's getting stronger.

Now six in the morning, 
gave me no warning; 
I had to be on my way.
Lights passing and trucks a flashing,
I'm on my way home from your place.

And now the sun's coming up, 
I'm riding with Lady Luck, 
freeway cars and trucks.
