Well, we dig, dig, dig
Well, we dig in our mine the whole day through
Dig, dig, dig, that is what we like to do
And it ain't no trick to get rich quick

If you dig, dig, dig, with a shovel and a pick
Dig, dig, dig, the whole day through
Got to dig, dig, dig, it's what we like to do
In our mine, in our mine

Where a million diamonds shine
We got to dig, dig, dig, from the morning till the night
Dig, dig, dig up everything in sight
We got to dig, dig, dig, in our mine, in our mine

Dig up diamonds by the score
A thousand rubies, sometimes more
But we don't know what we are diggin' for, yeah

Heigh ho, heigh ho, it's off to work we go
We keep on singing all day long, heigh ho
Heigh ho, heigh ho, got to make your troubles go
Well, you keep on singing all day long, heigh ho, heigh ho, heigh ho
