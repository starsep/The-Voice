Oh mother I want a dog
I want a little dog
I saw a little dog
His name is happy

Well this is me ...
... old ...
I could be a shopkeeper
We'll call 'em ...

She got a six foot pitchfork
I see the wrecking-ball
Back over here together
She got me here with or without

She got me coming through the dog door
She got me coming through the dog door

I said pitchfork
Oh step-ladders

You oughta walk away
But you can't ...
... stairs
She got me gone back here
But don't sit there
She let me keep the deck-chair

She got me coming through the dog door
She got me coming through the dog door

Pitchfork (pitchfork)
Crowbar (crowbar)
Clawhammer (clawhammer)
Hot tar (hot tar)

She got me through her middle name
But she can make it rain
She got a small-town chill
And she's starving in the belly wheel

She got me coming through the dog door
She got me coming through the dog door

Pitchfork (pitchfork)
Crowbar (crowbar)
Clawhammer (clawhammer)
Hot tar (hot tar)
