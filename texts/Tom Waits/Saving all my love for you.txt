It's too early for the circus, it's too late for the bars, no one's sleepin'
But the paperboys, and no one in this town is makin' any noise, but the dogs
And the milkmen and me.

The girls around here all look like cadillacs, no one likes a stranger here,
I'd come home but i'm afraid that you won't take me back, but i'd trade off
Everything just to have you near.

I know i'm irresponsible and i don't behave, and i ruin everything that i
Do, and i'll probably get arrested when i'm in my grave, but i'll be savin'
All my love for you.

I paid fifteen dollars for a prostitute, with too much makeup and a broken
Shoe, but her eyes were just a counterfeit, she tried to gyp me out of it, but
You know that i'm still in love you.

Don't listen to the rumors that you hear about me, cause i ain't as bad as
They make me out to be, well i may lose my mind but baby can't you see, that
I'll be savin' all my love for you.
