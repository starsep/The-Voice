Phone's off the hook
No one knows where we are
It's a long time since I drank champagne
The ocean is blue
As blue as your eyes
I'm gonna take it with me when I go

Old long since gone
Now way back when we lived in Coney Island
Ain't no good thing ever dies
I'm gonna take it with me when I go

Far far away a train whistle blows
Wherever you're goin
Wherever you've been
Waving good bye at the end of the day
You're up and you're over
And you're far away

Always for you and forever yours
It felt just like the old days
We fell asleep on Beaula's porch
I'm gonna take it with me when I go

All broken down by the side of the road
I was never more alive or alone
I've worn the faces off all the cards
I'm gonna take it with me when I go

Children are playing at the end of the day
Strangers are singing on our lawn
It's got to be more than flesh and bone
All that you're loved is all you own

In a land there's a town
And in that town there's a house
And in that house there's a woman
And in that woman there's a heart I love
I'm gonna take it with me when I go
I'm gonna take it with me when I go
