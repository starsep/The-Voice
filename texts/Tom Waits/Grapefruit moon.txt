Grapefruit moon, one star shining, shining down on me.
I heard that tune, and now I'm pining, honey, can't you see?
That every time I hear that melody, something breaks inside,
And grapefruit moon, one star shining, can't turn back the tide.

Never had no destination, could not get across.
You became my inspiration, oh but what a cost.
'Cause every time I hear that melody, puts me up a tree,
And grapefruit moon, one star shining, is all that I can see.

Now I'm smoking cigarettes and I strive for purity,
And I slip just like the stars into obscurity.
'Cause every time I hear that melody, well, something breaks inside,
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is much too big to hide.
