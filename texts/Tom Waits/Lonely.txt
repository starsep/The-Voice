Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely face, lonely lonely in your place.
Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely face, lonely lonely in your place.

I thought that i knew all that there was to, lonely, lonely, lonely...

Melanie jane, won't feel the pain.
Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely eyes, lonely lonely in your place.

And i thought that i knew all that there was to
Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely eyes, lonely lonely in your place, and
I still love you, i still love you, lonely, lonely...
