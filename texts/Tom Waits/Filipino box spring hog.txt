I hung on to Mary's stump
I danced with a soldier's glee
With a rum soaked crook and a big fat laugh
I spent my last dollar on thee
I saw Bill Bones, gave him a yell
Kehoe spiked the nog
With a chain link fence and a scrap iron jaw
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring hog

Spider rolled in from Hollister Burn
On a one-eyed stolen Mare
Donned himself with chicken fat
Sawin on a jaw bone violin there
Kathleen was sittin down in little reds recovery room
In her criminal underwear bra
I was naked to the waist with my fierce black hound
And I'm cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

Dig a big pit in a dirt alley road
Fill it with madrone and bay
Stinks like hell and the neighbors complain
Don't give a hoot what they say
Gotta slap that hog
Roll em over twice
Gotta baste him with a sweeping broom
You gotta swat them flies and chain up the dogs
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

Rattle snake piccata with grapes and figs
Old brown Betty with a yellow wig
Tain't the mince meat filagree
And it ain't the turkey neck stew
And it ain't them bruleed Okra seeds
Though she made them especially for you
Worse won a prize for her bottom black pie
The beans got to thrown to the dogs
Jaheseus Christ I can always make room
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
