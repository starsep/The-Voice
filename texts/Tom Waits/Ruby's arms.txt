I will leave behind all of my clothes, i wore when i was with you, all i
Need's my railroad boots, and my leather jacket, as i say goodbye to ruby's
Arms, although my heart is breaking, i will steal away out through your
Blinds, for soon you will be waking.

The morning light has washed your face, and everything is turning blue now,
Hold on to your pillow case there's nothing i can do now, as i say goodbye to
Ruby's arms, you'll find another soldier, and i swear to god by christmas,
There'll be someone else to hold you.

The only thing i'm taking is the scarf off of your clothesline, i'll hurry
Past your chest of drawers, and your broken window chimes, as i say goodbye
I'll say goodbye, say goodbye to ruby's arms.

I'll feel my way down the darken hall, and out into the morning, the hobos
At the freightyards, have kept their fires burning, so jesus christ this
Goddamn rain, will someone put me on a train, i'll never kiss your lips again,
Or break your heart, as i say goodbye i'll say goodbye, say goodbye to ruby's
Arms.
