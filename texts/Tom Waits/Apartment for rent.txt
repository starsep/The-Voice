Well, it ain't no use, it ain't no good
And there's too many ghosts in this neighborhood
A quaint little walk up is bringing me down
I have to find another crib on the other side of town

The old Murphey bed and the empty chest of drawers
And a little dinette set, I'll stroll across the floor
And the trash cans in the alley, well they're rattlin' and sayin'
That there's an apartment for rent
On a rainy September day

Apartment for rent
Furnished with blue lights, baby
Apartment for rent
And the market's open all night
Well you see, I'm sweeping out the cobwebs
The lady she got away
There's an apartment for rent
On a rainy September day

Well, I'm pouring over the classified section
You see, she's lost all her affection for me
I was drinking and smoking
I was staying out all night long
When you needed me here with you at home

There's an apartment for rent
Furnished with blue lights baby
Apartment for rent
And the market's open all night
Yeah, I've been sweeping up the cobwebs
The lady got away
There's an apartment for rent
There's an apartment for rent
There's an apartment for rent
On a rainy September day
Apartment for rent
