You dance real slow
You wreck it down
Then you walk away you turn around
What did that old blonde gal say?
That is the part you throw away

I want that beggar’s eyes
A winning horse
A tidy Mexican divorce
St. Mary’s prayers, Houdini’s hands
And a barman who always
Understands

Will you loose the flowers
Hold on to the vase?
Will you wipe all those teardrops away from your face?
I can’t help feeling as I close the door
I have done all of this
Many times before

But the bone must go
The wish can stay
The kiss don’t know what the lips will say
Forget I've hurt you
Put stones in our bed
And remember to never
Mind instead

But all of your letters burned up in the fire
And time is just memory mixed with desire
That’s not the road t is only the map, I say
Gone just like matches
From a closed down cabaret

In a Portuguese saloon
A fly is circling around the room
You’ll soon forget the tune that you play
Cause that is the part
You throw away
Oh that is the part
You throw away
