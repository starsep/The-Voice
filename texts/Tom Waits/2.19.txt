I lost everything I had in the ’29 flood
The barn was buried ‘neath a mile of mud
Now I’m down to nothing but the whistle and the steam
My baby’s leaving town on the 2:19

I said, hey, hey, I don’t know what to do
I will remember you
Hey, hey, I don’t know what to do
My baby’s leaving town on the 2:19

Now there’s a fellow that’s preaching ‘bout hell and damnation
Bouncing off the walls of the Grand Central Station
I treated her bad, I treated her mean
Baby leaving town on the 2:19

I said, hey, hey, I will remember you
Hey, hey, I don’t know what to do
Hey, I don’t know what to do
My baby’s leaving town on the 2:19

Now I’ve always been puzzled by the yin and the yang
It’ll come out in the wash but it always leaves a stain
Sturm and Drang, the luster and the sheen
My baby’s leaving town on the...

Hey, hey, I don’t know what to do
Hey, hey, I will remember you
Hey, hey, I will remember you
My baby’s leaving town on the 2:19

Lost the baby with the water and the preacher stole the bride
Sent her out for a bottle but when she came back inside
She didn’t have my whiskey, didn’t have my gin
With a hat full of feathers and a wicked grin

I said, hey, hey, I will remember you
Yeah baby, I will remember you
My baby’s leaving town on the 2:19

On the train you get smaller as you get farther away
The roar covers everything you wanted to say
Was that a raindrop or a tear in your eye?
Were you drying your nails or waving goodbye?

Hey, hey, I will remember you
Hey, hey, I don’t know what to do
Oh baby
My baby’s leaving town on the 2:19

I will remember you
I don’t know what to do, baby
