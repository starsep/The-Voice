If you want money in your pocket
And a top hat on your head
A hot meal on your table
And a blanket on your bed
Well today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here
Well i'm going to new york city
And i'm leaving on a train
And if you want to stay behind and
Wait til i come back again
Well today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here
If you want to go
Where the rainbows end
You'll have to say goodbye
All our dreams come true
Baby up ahead
And it's out where your memories lie
Well the road's out before me
And the moon is shining bright
What i want you to remember
As i disappear tonight
Today is grey skies
Tomorrow's tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here
