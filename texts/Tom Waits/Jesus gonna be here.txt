Well, jesus will be here
Be here soon
He's gonna cover us up with leaves
With a blanket from the moon
With a promise and a vow
And a lullaby for my brow
Jesus gonna be here
Be here soon

Well i'm just gonna wait here
I don't have to shout
I have no reason and
I have no doubt
I'm gonna get myself
Unfurled from this mortal coiled up world
Because jesus gonna be here
Be here soon

I got to keep my eyes open
So i can see my lord
I'm gonna watch the horizon
For a brand new ford

I can hear him rolling on down the lane
I said hollywood be thy name
Jesus gonna be
Gonna be here soon

Well i've been faithful
And i've been so good
Except for drinking
But he new that i would
I'm gonna leave this place better
Than the way i found it was
And jesus gonna be here
Be here soon
