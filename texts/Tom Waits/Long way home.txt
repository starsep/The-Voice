Well I stumbled in the darkness
I’m lost and alone
Though I said I’d go before us
Show the way back home
Is there a light up ahead?
I can’t hold on very long
Forgive me pretty baby but I always take the long way home

Money is just something you throw
Off the back of a train
Got a head full of lightning 
A hat full of rain
And I know that I said 
I’d never do it again
I love you pretty baby but I always take the long way home

I put food on the table

And a roof overhead
But I’d trade it all tomorrow 
For the highway instead
Watch your back 
And pass your time
Love’s the only thing I’ve ever known
One thing for sure pretty baby I always take the long way home

You know I love you baby
More than the whole wide world
You are my woman
You know you are my pearl
Let’s go out past the party lights
Where we can finally be alone
Come with me together we can take the long way home
Come with me together we can take the long way home
Come with me together we can take the long way home
