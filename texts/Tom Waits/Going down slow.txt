Well it's a quarter a two
And looking at you
And going down, going down slow
Well it's a quarter a two
And looking at you
And going down, going down slow

Tv went off about one, we have only begun
I know that the wednesday may come
But i have no intention of going home

Well it's a quarter a three
Digging on me
And going down, going down slow

Could stay here all night,
They claim your outta sight
Please get up and turn out the light
There ain't nothing better than the middle of the night

And it's a quarter a four
Begging for more
And going down, going down slow
Going down, going down slow
Going down, going down slow
Going down, going down slow
