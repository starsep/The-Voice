This is how the world will be
Everywhere I go it rains on me
Forty monkeys drowning in a boiling sea
Everywhere I go it rains on me
I went down into the valley to pray
Everywhere I go it rains on me
I got drunk and I stayed all day
Everywhere I go it rains on me

Everywhere I go, everywhere I go
Everywhere I go, it rains on me

All God's chilluns can't you see
Everywhere I go it rains on me
Louie Lista and Marchese
Everywhere I go it rains on me
Robert Sheehan and Paul Body
Everywhere I go it rains on me
I went down to Argyle I went down to Dix
Everywhere I go it rains on me
To get my powders and to get my fix
Everywhere I go it rains on me

Everywhere I go, everywhere I go
Everywhere I go, it rains on me
Everywhere I go, everywhere I go
Everywhere I go, it rains on me
