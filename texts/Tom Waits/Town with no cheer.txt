Well it's hotter 'n blazes and all the long faces
There'll be no oasis for a dry local grazier
There'll be no refreshment for a thirsty jackaroo
From melbourne to adelaide on the overlander
With newfangled buffet cars and faster locomotives
The train stopped in serviceton less and less often
There's nothing sadder than a town with no cheer
Voc rail decided the canteen was no longer necessary there
No spirits, no bilgewater and 80 dry locals
And the high noon sun beats a hundred and four
There's a hummingbird trapped in a closed down shoe store

This tiny victorian rhubarb
Kept the watering hole open for sixty five years
Now it's boilin' in a miserable march 21 st
Wrapped the hills in a blanket of patterson's curse
The train smokes down the xylophone
There'll be no stopping here
All ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheer
No bourbon, no branchwater
Though the townspeople here
Fought her vic rail decree tooth and nail
Now it's boilin' in a miserable march 21 st
Wrapped the hills in a blanket of patterson's curse
The train smokes down the xylophone
There'll be no stopping here
All ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheer
