Life is whittled
Life's a riddle
Man's a fiddle that life plays on
When the day breaks and the earth quakes
Life's a mistake all day long
Tell me, who gives a good goddamn
You'll never get out alive
Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In a crooked ol' world

Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale

Don't take my word
Just look skyward
They that dance must pay the fiddler
Sky is darkening
Dogs are barking
But the caravan moves on
You tell me, who gives a good goddamn
You'll never get out alive
Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In a crooked ol' world

Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
Oh we're starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale

As the crow flies
It's there the truth lies
At the bottom of the well
E-o-Leven goes to heaven
Bless the dead here as the rain falls
Don't trust a bull's horn
A doberman's tooth
A runaway horse or me
Don't be greedy, don't be needy
If you live in hope
You're dancing to a terrible tune

Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
Oh starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
