In the evening he stumbles home with his tie undone,
As the moon sweeps 7th avenue, as usual

You lie awake at night
You remember when
Now that Annie's back in town

Well I know why you're drinking
I know your alibi
So don't make excuses
Those are tears in your eyes
And you're falling back
In love
Again
Now that Annie's back in town

Well it came down through the grapevine
It put your business on the street
I hear you've been hanging out till dawn
In some lunch room (somewhere)
Well you thought you've gotten over her
But that was till you found
That Annie's back in town

All the corner boys are all trouble-makers
And the sailors are all fools
Well it seems like some things round here
I guess they'll never change
Oh but it's always good for business
Guess we'll be seeing you around
Now that Annie's back in town
