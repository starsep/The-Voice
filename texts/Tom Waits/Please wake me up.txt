I put my chips on her shoulder
Running in the carnival time
She bought the things that i told her
They made her eyes sparkle and shine
Together we'll ring in the new year
I know that she'll be my queen
And if i fall asleep in your arms
Please wake me up in my dreams
Her out-fit was all made of vinyl
Like nothing i've ever seen
When our divorces are final
She'll fit right into my scheme
Next to the pawnshop's a chapel
I'll show you just what i mean
And if i fall asleep in your arms
Please wake me up in my dreams
