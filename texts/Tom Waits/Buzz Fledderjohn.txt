I stood on the roof, stood toward dark
To get a better look at the Fledderjons' lawn
Big sharp pistols, ammo too
Nothing but books about World War II
Rottweiler, Dobermann, a Pinkerton guard
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjon's yard

I ain't allowed
No, I ain't allowed
I said, I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjon's yard

I seen a python swallowing a Dobermann whole
Piranhas swimming in a mixing bowl
Buzz Fledderjon

Paper's full of stabbings, the sky's full of crows
She's singing in Italian while she's hanging out her clothes
Carp in the bathtub and it's raining real hard
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjon's yard

I said that I ain't allowed
No, I ain't allowed
No, I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjon's yard.

Well, the sailor's ringing doorbells, the sinner's in the pew
Weathervane's squeaking to the west
I seen the cliffs of Dover and the deepest ocean blue
One thing in the world I can't recommend to you

Because I ain't allowed
I said, I ain't allowed
No, I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjon's yard

I said, I ain't allowed
No, I ain't allowed
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjon's yard

I ain't allowed
I ain't allowed
I said, I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjon's yard
