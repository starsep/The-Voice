Well i pulled on trouble's braids
And i hid in the briars
Out by the quick mud
Stayin' away from the main roads
Passin' out wolf tickets
Downwind from the blood hounds
And i pulled on trouble's braids
And i lay by a cypress
As quiet as a stone
'til the bleeding stopped
I blew the weather vane
Off some old road house
I build a fire in the
Skeleton back seat of an old tucker
And i pulled on trouble's braids
I spanked cold red mud
Where the hornet stung deep
And i tossed in the ditch
In a restless sleep
And i pulled on trouble's braids
I hung my rain-soaked jacket
On some old barbed wire
Poured cold rusty water
On a miserable fire
I pulled on trouble's braids
The creek was swollen by daybreak and i could just
Barely see
And i floated downstream
On an old dead tree
And i pulled on trouble's braids
I pulled on trouble's braids
I pulled on trouble's braids
I pulled on trouble's braids
