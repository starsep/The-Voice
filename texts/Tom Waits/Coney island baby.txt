Every night she comes
To take me out to dreamland
When I'm with her
I'm the richest man in the town
She's a rose, she's a pearl
She the spin on my world
All the stars make their wishes on her eyes

She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl

She's a princess in a red dress
She's the moon in the mist to me

She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl

Every night she comes
To take me out to dreamland
When I'm with her
I'm the richest man in the town
She's a rose, she's a pearl
She the spin on my world
All the stars make their wishes on her eyes

She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl

She's a princess in a red dress
She's the moon in the mist to me

She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl
She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl
