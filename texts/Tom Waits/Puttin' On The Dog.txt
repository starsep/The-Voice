You gotta stomp, whistle and scream
You gotta wake right up in your dreams
You gotta jump, wheel and drive
Keep that feeling alive

You gotta kick, holler and shout
I'm gonna tell you what it's all about
You gotta tell me that you love me
Tell me that you're mine

We're putting on the dog tonight
We're putting on the dog tonight
We'll be p...putting on the dog tonight
Putting on, putting on the dog tonight
We'll be putting on the dog tonight
We'll be putting on the dog tonight
Putting on the dog
Putting on the dog

We'll flip, we'll follow and fly
Just do it now and don't ask why
You gotta strut, wiggle and slide
Let everybody know that you're alive

You gotta crank, gallop and twist
Do it once, you'll never resist
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you're mine

We're putting on the dog tonight
Putting on the dog tonight, alright

Well we'll be going to a sooky jump it's rain and it pours
Big old Lecky with his suicide doors
Tip that bottle from the brim to the dregs
You ain't dancing 'till you cross your legs

Putting on the dog tonight
We'll be putting on the dog tonight
We'll be putting on the dog tonight
Putting on the dog tonight
Putting on the dog
I've been p...putting on the dog
Putting on the dog
Putting on the dog
Putting on the dog
Putting on the dog
