Well i broke down in e. st. louis
On the kansas city line
And i drunk up all my money
That i borrowed every time
And i fell down at the derby
And now the night's black as a crow
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home
What made my dreams so hollow
Was standing at the depot
With a steeple full of swallows
That could never ring the bell
And i come ten thousand miles away
With not one thing to show
Well it was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home
I remember when i left
Without bothering to pack
You know i up and left with
Just the clothes i had on my back
Now i'm sorry for what i've done
And i'm out here on my own
Well it was a train that took me away from
Here but a train can't bring me home
