They say you're seeing someone, you're wearing his ring
They say you laughed when you heard my name
They say he takes you dancing, he holds you so near
They say he'll buy you anything
Tell me am I foolish, I don't believe these stories
And I'll be coming home soon

Louise, Louise, if it's true
Tell it to me

I know, you will not see me, but I know you have a daughter
And I hear she has my eyes
They say she calls him "father", and he's proud of her
And even believes all of your lies
But for all your faithless beauty, I'd give all my tomorrows
And if you're still thinking of me
Louise, Louise, if it's true
Tell it to me

Oh Louise, Louise, if it's true
Tell it to me
Oh Louise, Louise, if it's true
Tell it to me
