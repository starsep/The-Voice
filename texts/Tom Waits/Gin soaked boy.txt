I got a belly full of you
And that leavenworth stuff
Now i'm gonna get out
And i'm gonna get tough
You been lying to me
How could you crawl so low
With some gin-soaked boy
That you don't know

I come home last night
Full a filth of old crow
You said you goin' to your ma's
But where the hell did you go
You went and slipped out nights
You didn't think that i'd know
With some
Gin-soaked boy that you don't know

Well i would bet you as far
As oklahoma by now
The dogs are barking out back
And you're knittin' your brow
Well i'm on your tail i sussed your m.o.
From some gin-soaked boy
Boy that you don't know
