Well I'm sittin' right here in my rockin chair
Running my fingers right through my hair
Fire is flicken with a yellow and gold
Makin me quiver in the snowy cold
Got a lazy old woman
Screaming bout my money
She took every cent
And she didn't leave me any

Times were never so good, got a fly for food
Got no woman to spend my money
Well she blew and took all my money

So I'm sittin' right here in my rockin chair
Running my fingers right through my hair
Spider caught the fly in his web
Do believe he may be dead

Times were never so good, got a fly for food
Got no woman to spend my money
Well she blew and took all my money

Well I'm sittin' and I'm sittin' and I'm sittin' right here
In my rockin chair
Watchin' my old dog loosing his hair
