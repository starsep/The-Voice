There's a blue eyed girl with a red bow tie
and a string of pearls with one good eye
in a rainy town the chimney smoke will curl
no one likes clowns on the other side of the world
and the children know she'll never let me go.

there's a one legged priest that tangos with the farmers wife
Beauty and the beast is taking her own life
and a tear on a letter back home turns into a lake of your own
and a crow turns into a girl on the other side of the world
and she tastes like the sea and she's waiting for me

in the spring the weeds will show that he brought back the only rose
and he gave it to his girl on the other side of the world.
And I drink champagne from your thin blue veins

She visits his grave wearing her mother's shawl
should I shave or end it all.
There's an old sailor song that the children know
as their fingers curl around the other side of the world
on a bone white mare lost in Kathleen's hair

in the spring the weeds will show that he brought back the only rose
and he gave it to his girl on the other side of the world.
