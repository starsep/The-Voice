I can see clearly nothing as clear
I keep falling apart ev'ry year
Let's take a hammer to it
There's no glamour in it
Is there any way out of this dream

I'm as blue as I can possibly be
Is there someone else out there for me
Summer is dragging it's feet
I feel so incomplete
Is there any way out of this dream
