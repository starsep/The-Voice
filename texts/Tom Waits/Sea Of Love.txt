Come with me my love to the sea
The sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you
I'm drowning in a sea of love

Do you remember the night we met?
That's the night I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you
I'm drowning in a sea of love

Come with me to the sea

Do you remember the night we met?
That's the night I just knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you
I'm down in a sea of love

Come with me to the sea

Do you remember the night we met?
That's the night I just knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you
I'm down in a sea of love

Come with me to the sea

Do you remember the night we met?
That's the night I just knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you
I'm down here in a sea of love

Come with me to the sea

Come with me my love to the sea
The sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you
I'm down here in a sea of love

Come with me to the sea
