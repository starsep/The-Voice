Why be sweet, why be careful, why be kind?
A man has only one thing on his mind
Why ask politely, why go lightly, why say please?
They only want to get you on your knees
There's a few things that I never could believe

A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
And everything goes to hell, anyway

Laissez-faire mi amour, ce la vie
Shall I return to shore or swim back out to sea?
The world don't care what a sailor does in town
It's all hanging in the windows by the pound
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
Everything goes to hell, anyway

I only want to hear you purr and to hear you moan
You have another man who brings the money home
I don't want dishes in the sink
Don't ask me what I feel or what I think
There's a few things that I never could believe

A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
Everything goes to hell, anyway

Everything goes to hell, anyway
Oh, everything goes to hell, anyway
