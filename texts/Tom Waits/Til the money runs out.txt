Check this strange beverage that falls out from the sky, splashin' bagdad on
The hudson in panther martin's eyes, he's high and outside wearin' candy apple
Red, scarlet gave him twenty seven stitches in his head, with a pint of green
Chartruse ain't nothin' seems right, you buy the sunday paper on a saturday
Night.

Can't you hear the thunder someone stole my watch, i sold a quart of blood
And bought a half a pint of scotch, some one tell those chinamen on telegraph
Canyon road, when you're on the bill with the spoon there ain't no time to
Unload, so bye bye baby baby bye bye.

Droopy stranger lonely dreamer toy puppy and the prado, we're laughin' as
They piled into olmos' el dorado, jesus whispered eni meany miney moe, they're
Too proud to duck their heads that's why they bring it down so low, so bye
Bye baby baby bye bye.

The pointed man is smack dab in the middle of july, swingin' from the
Rafters in his brand new tie, he said i can't go back to that hotel room all
They do is shout, but i'll stay wichew baby till the money runs out, so bye
Bye baby baby bye bye.
