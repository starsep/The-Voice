You can't unring a bell, junior
It'll cost ya to get out of this one, junior
Cause he's got big plans
That don't include you
Take it like a man

Cause you, you can't unring a bell, sucker
You'll need an attorney for this journey, junior

How's it feel
How do you like it in the slam
You're a little man in a great big town
Perhaps you were a little hasty
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh
You can't take back the things you said, man

Cause you can't unring a bell, Junior
Aaghhhh
Hurts don't it
Take it like a man
Get it thru your head
Suffer
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh
