Strip Poker Motel
Got a small blue tail
Hot ice, cold cash
I never been no good at staying out of jail

Wheel spin, roulette
Who's giving, don't get
Ripped shirt, black eye
Tuxedo, bow tie
Dark sound, straight road
Get lost, get loaded
Enlisted men, off duty
Stolen clouds, dark beauty
Cold gun, wild rose
Night clerk, door closed

Lie down baby
Your love is a faucet

Called China, cell phone
Chun King, not home

You know I feel like a preacher waving a gun around
Shake it, shake it. shake it baby!

Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Shake it, shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Shake it, shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it now

Outside, it's damp
Put a towel on that lamp
You look hot in this light
I can love you all night
Shoes off, hair down
Got a pink night gown
Mike Tyson, KO'ed
On the wild, blue road
Small town, straight road
That rooster, done crowed
Flat tire, homemade cross

You know I feel like a preacher waving a gun around
Shake it, shake it, shake it baby!

Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Shake it. shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
