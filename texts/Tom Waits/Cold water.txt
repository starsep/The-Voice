Well I woke up this morning with the cold water
With the cold water, with the cold water
Woke up this morning with the cold water
With the cold water, with the cold

Well the police at the station and they don't look friendly
Well they don't look friendly, Well they don't look friendly
Police at the station and they don't look friendly
Well they don't look friendly, well they don't

Blind or crippled, sharp or dull
I'm reading the Bible by a 40 watt bulb
What price freedom, dirt is my rug
Well I sleep like a baby
With the snakes and the bugs

Well the stores are open but I ain't got no money
Well ain't got no money, well I ain't got no money
Stores are open but I ain't got no money
Well ain't got no money, well I ain't

Found an old dog and he seems to like me
Seems to like me, well he seems to like me
Found an old dog and he seems to like me
Seems to like me, well he seems

Seen them fellows with the card board signs
Scrapin up a little money to buy a bottle of wine
Pregnant women and the Vietnam vets I say
Beggin on the freeway bout as hard as it gets

Well I slept in the graveyard it was cool and still
Cool and still, it was cool and still
Slept in the graveyard it was cool and still
Cool and still and it was cool

Slept all night in a Cedar grove
I was born to ramble, born to rove
Some men are searchin for the Holy Grail
But there ain't nothin sweeter than ridin the rail

I look 47 but I'm 24
Well they shooed me away from here the time before
Turned their backs and they locked their doors
I'm watching T.V. in the window of a furniture store

And I woke up this morning with the cold water
With the cold water, with the cold water
I woke up this morning with the cold water
With the cold water, with the cold

Well I woke up this morning with the cold water
Cold water, with the cold water
Woke up this morning with the cold water
Cold water, with the cold
