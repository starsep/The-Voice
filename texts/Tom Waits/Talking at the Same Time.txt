Get a job, save your money, listen to Jane
Everybody knows umbrellas will cost more in the rain
And all the news is bad
Is there any other kind?
And everybody's talking at the same time
And everybody's talking at the same time

Well it's hard times for some
For others it's sweet
Someone makes money when there's blood in the street
Don't take any lip
Stay in line
Everybody's talking at the same time

Well the dog is in the kitchen
And the war drags on
The trees wait by the freeway
All the money's gone
Well she told me she would leave me
I ignored all the signs
And now everybody's talking at the same time
Everybody's talking at the same time

Ain't no one coming to pull you from the mud
You gotta build your nest high enough to ride out the flood
I know you're leaving and there's no more next time
Everybody's talking at the same time

Well a tiny boy sat and he played in the sand
He made a sword from a stick
And a gun from his hand
Well we bailed out all the millionaires
They've got the fruit
We've got the rind
And everybody's talking at the same time
Everybody's talking at the same time
