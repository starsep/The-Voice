Are you ready, are you ready
Knocky Parker told Bowlegged Sal
They all know how to kick it in Cal
They're playing this dope and this
Money tune
Dancing baby with a 7 mile broom
Things are bulging out the rafters
Like hell
Dddddown there at the Hush Hotel
They're jumping right out of their
Seats, dancing to the bran' new beat

Do... the Metropolitan Glide [2x]

The floor is polished and you
Momma's gone
You can quake and roll and moan
29 gypsies in a Caddilac stoned
Turn off the ringer on your cellular phone
Whip the air like a Rainbow Trout
Drag your tail pipe till you bottom out

Do... the Metropolitan Glide [4x]

The low bottom of the china moon
The black swan and the way too soon
Ace pocket and teh dog bone gone
The peacock and the mean black swan
The rain shower and high heeled shoe
Bombay money and I know I can do it
The sink hole and the victory dance
Its in the pocket in the real tight pants

Ddddo the Metropolitan Glide [2x]

Show your teeth bray like a falf
You kill me with your machine gun laugh
You make me trouble with the floor
THat's creaking
I"ve been ready to ka boom for a week
Put on your stockings and your powder and blush
Keep it all on the hush, hush, hush

Do... the Metropolitan Glide [2x]
