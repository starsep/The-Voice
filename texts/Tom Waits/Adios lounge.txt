I know an oldtimer
Just a nickel-and-dimer
At the bar down the Adios Lounge
And for whiskey and smokes
Recites poems and jokes
But he's not just your average clown
And he's entertaining nightly
Down the Adios Lounge
And he puts it politely
But he does lay it down

Now I lie here alone in my bed
With these words running wild in my head
He said...

Don't let nobody go there for you
Don't be satisfied with a second-hand life
Don't let nobody stifle or bore you
Handle your troubles or take on your strife
Don't let nobody live your life for you
Not your friends, not your kids, no not even your wife
If you want to know where the rainbow ends
It's you whoÂ´ve got to go there and find it my friend

So I'm going back down
To the Adios Lounge
Where there's no one to wait up for me
I hope he's still around
Oh, that crazy old scrounge
To tell us how things ought to be
He said...

Don't let nobody go there for you
Don't be satisfied with a second-hand life
Don't let nobody stifle or bore you
Handle your troubles or take on your strife
Don't let nobody live your life for you
Not your friends, not your kids, no not even your wife
If you want to know where the rainbow ends
It's you who've got to go there and find it my friend

So I buy him more drinks
Just to hear what he thinks
Oh, it's worth it to see him almost smile
It's worth feeling free for a while
At the bar down the Adios Lounge
At the bar down the Adios Lounge
At the bar down the Adios Lounge
