Well the eggs chase the bacon
Round the fryin' pan
And the whinin' dog pidgeons
By the steeple bell rope
And the dogs tipped the garbage pails
Over last night
And there's always construction work
Bothering you
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood

Friday's a funeral
And saturday's a bride
Sey's got a pistol on the register side
And the goddamn delivery trucks
They make too much noise
And we don't get our butter
Delivered no more
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood

Well big mambo's kicking
His
And the kids can't get ice cream
'cause the market burned down
And the newspaper sleeping bags
Blow down the lane
And that goddamn flatbed's
Got me pinned in again
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood

There's a couple filipino girls
Gigglin' by the church
And the windoe is busted
And the landlord ain't home
And butch joined the army
Yea that's where he's been
And the jackhammer's diggin'
Up the sidewalks again
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
