Hang on St. Christopher through the smoke and the oil
Buckle down the rumble seat
let the radiator boil
got an overhead downshift
and a two dollar grill
got an 85 cabin
on an 85 hill
hang on St. Christopher on the passenger side
open it up tonight the devil can ride
hang on St. Christopher with a barrel house dog
kick me up mt. baldy
throw me out in the fog
tear a hole in the jack pot
drive a stake through his heart
do a 100 on the grapevine
do a jump on the start
hang on St. Christopher now don't let me go
get me to Reno and bring it in low, yeah
hang on St. Christopher with the hammer to the floor
put a hi ball in the crank case
nail a crow to the door
get a bottle for the jockey
gimme a 294
there's a 750 Norton bustin' down January's door
hang on St. Christopher on the passenger side
open it up tonight the devil can ride
hang on St. Christopher now don't let me go
get to Reno got to bring it in low
put my baby on the flat car
got to burn down the caboose
get 'em all jacked up on whiskey
then we'll turn the mad dog loose
hang on St. Christopher on the passenger side
open it up tonight the devil can ride on yeah
