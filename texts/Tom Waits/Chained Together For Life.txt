Did you hear the news about Edward?
On the back of his head he had another face
Was it a woman's face or a young girl?
They said to remove it would kill him
So poor Edward was doomed
The face could laugh and cry
It was his devil twin
And at night she spoke to him
Things heard only in hell
They were impossible to separate
Chained together for life
Finally the bell tolled his doom
He took a suite of rooms and hung himself and her from the balcony aisle
Some still believe he was freed from her
But I knew her too well
I say she drove him to suicide
And took poor Edward to hell
