Well I don't go to church on Sunday
Don't get on my knees to pray
Don't memorize the books of the Bible
Got my own special way
I know Jesus loves me
Maybe just a little bit more
I fall down on my knees every Sunday
At Zerelda Lee's candy store

Well I've got to be a chocolate Jesus
Make me feel good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied

Well I don't want no Abba Zabba
Don't want no Almond Joy
There ain't nothing better suitable for this boy
Well it's the only thing that can pick me up
Better than a cup of gold
See only a chocolate Jesus can satisfy my soul

When the weather gets rough
And it's whiskey in the shade
It's best to wrap your savior up in cellophane
He flows like the big muddy but that's ok
Pour him over ice cream for a nice parfait

Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Good enough for me
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Good enough for me

Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Make me feel so good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied
