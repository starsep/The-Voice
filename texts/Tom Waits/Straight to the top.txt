I'm going straight to the top
Oh yea up where the air is
Fresh and clean
I'm going straight up to the top
If you know me, you know what i mean
I can't let sorrow
Try and pull ol' frankie down
Live for tomorrow i have found you
I'm going straight up to the top
Up where the air is fresh and clean
I know that i will never stop, oh no
Until i know i'm wild and free
Just like a champagne bubble
Pop pop pop
I'm like those birdies
High up in the trees
I can't let sorrow
Pull ol' frankie down
Live for tomorrow
I have found you
I'm going straight up to the top oh yeah
Up where the air is fresh and clean
