It's dreamy weather we're on
You wave your crooked wand
Along an icy pond
With a frozen moon
A murder of silhouette crows
I saw...
And the tears on my face
And the skates on the pond they spell Alice
I'll disappear in your name
But you must wait for me
Somewhere across the sea
There's the wreck of a ship
Your hairis like meadow grass
On the tide
And the raindrops on my window
And the ice in my drink
Baby, all that
I can think of is Alice
Arithmetic
Arithmetock
I turn the hands back on the clock
How does the ocean rock the boat
How did the razor find my troath

The only strings that hold me here
Are tangled up around the pier
And so a secret kiss
Brings madness with the bliss
And I will think of this
When I'm dead in my grave
Set me adrift and I'm lost over there
But I must be insane
To go skating on your name
And by tracing it twice
I fell trough the ice
Of Alice
There's onely Alice
