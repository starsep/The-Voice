The things a crow puts in its nest,
They're always things it finds that shine. 
And how he'll find a shiny dime,
Silver twine, from a valentine. 
The crows all bring them shiny things. 

Leave me alone you big ol' moon, 
The light you cast is just a lighter.
You're like the crow, ''cause if it goes,

You're dressed to go, you guessed, I know,
You'll always bring them shiny things. 

Well I'm not dancing here tonight,
But things are bound to turn around. 
The only thing I want that shines, 
Is to be king there in your eyes.
To be your only shiny thing.
