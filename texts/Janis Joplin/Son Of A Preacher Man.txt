Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered round and started talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
Out through the backyard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my suprise

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was he was, yes, he was

Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I tried
When he started sweet talkin' to me
He'd come and tell me everything is alright
He'd kiss and tell me everything's alright
Can I get away again tonight

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was he was , lord knows he was

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealing kisses from me on the sly
Taking time to make time
Telling me that he's all mine
Learning from each other's knowing
Looking to see how much we're growing

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was he was, oh yes, he was

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the sweet talkin' son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man....
