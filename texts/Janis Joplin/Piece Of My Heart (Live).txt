Ball and chain

Yeah, I heard that, man
How are you, how, I mean, er
How are you out there? Are you are you okay
You know that you stand stoned and you got enough water
And you got a place to sleep and everything

What does that mean? huh
Because, you know, because we ought, all of us
You know, I don't mean to be preachy but we ought to remember
That in that case it means promoters, too
That music's for grooving, man
And music's not for putting yourself through bad changes

You know, I mean you don't have to go take any body's shit
Man, just to like music, you know what I mean
You don't
So er, so if you're getting more shit than you deserve
You know what to do about it, man
You know, it's just music
Music's, music's supposed to be different than that

Hey, come on, come on, come on, come on

Didn't I make you feel, oh honey
Like you were the only man I ever wanted, that I ever needed?
Oh ho, honey, didn't I give you nearly everything
That I ever had to give?
Oh, you know I did

But each time I tell myself that I
I think I've had enough
Well, I'm gonna show you, baby
That a woman can be tough

I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah
Have a, have another little piece of my heart now, daddy daddy daddy
You know you got it if it makes you feel good
Yes indeed, whoa

You're out on the streets, you're looking good
Honey, deep down inside I know
You know it ain't never been right
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Hear me cry at night, oh

Each time I tell myself
That I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms
I'll sing it once again

Say come on, come on, yeah, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break another little piece of my heart, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Have another little piece of my heart, baby, baby, baby
You know you got it, if it makes you feel good
I want you to feel good now, yeah

Say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break another little piece of my heart, darling, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Have a, have another little piece of my heart, baby, baby, baby
You know you got it alright

Say whoa, have another little piece of my heart now, daddy
Break it, break it, break it
I want you to want it, take out the inside of me
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, baby, baby
You know you got it, if it makes you
I want you to feel good, Lord, alright
Yeah
