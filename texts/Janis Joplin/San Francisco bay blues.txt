I got my blues when my baby left me 
By the San Francisco Bay 
She's taken an ocean liner 
And she's gone so far away 
I didn't mean to treat her so bad 
She's the best girl I ever have had 
She said good-bye gonna make me cry 
I'm gonna lay down and die 

I haven't got a nickel 
Ain't got a lousy dime 
If she don't come back 
I think I'm goona lose my mind 
If she ever comes back to stay 
There's gonna be another brand new day 
Walkin' with my baby 
Down by the San Francisco Bay 

Sittin' down and lookin' through my back door 
Wonderin' which way to go 
Woman I'm so crazy about 
She don't want me no more 
Think I'll take me a freight train 
Because I'm feelin' blue 
Ride all the way to the end of the line 
Thinkin' only of you 

Meanwhile in another city 
Just about to go insane 
Seems like I heard my baby 
The way she used to call my name 
If she ever comes back to stay 
There's gonna be another brand new day 
Walkin' with my baby 
Down by the San Francisco Bay
