Didn't I make you feel, oh baby, like you were the only one
Baby didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can
Honey you know that I did
'Cos each time I tell myself that I, I think I've had enough
Oh, I am gonna show you baby, that a woman can be tough

I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on
And take it, take another little piece of my heart now baby
Break it, break another little bit of my heart now darling
Yeah, have a, have another little piece of my heart now, baby
'Cos you know you got it and it makes you feel good, yes it does

Yeah you're out on the street, babe you're looking good
Deep down in your heart, you know that it ain't right
No, no, 'cos you never, never, never hear me
When I cry out at night, honey I cry all the time
And each time I tell myself that I can stand the pain
Oh, you take me in your arms, I sing it once again

I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on
And take it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break it, break another little bit of my heart now darling, yeah
