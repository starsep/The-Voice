Janis Joplin!

Boy they're incredible.

Quiet, quiet!

I'll tell you one thing, we sure turned a trainful of freaks into a party, man, ha ha ha ha, didn't we, boys ? All right, all right, now what should I do ? Get it ?

"Get it While You Can" ? "Get it While You Can" !

All right. I'll do a song, man, that I'll tell you you could apply it to more or less to anything you want to but it could almost be even called the truth man. I wouldn't go that far, I wouldn't heavy up on anyone like that, man. I'll tell you one thing, songs got something to say, man, if you can dig it. It's talking about everybody's life, man, and what passes by you and what you miss and what you're gonna have, man. This is a song called Get it While You Can 'cause it ain't gonna be there when you wake up, man. (On Richard!) Richard Bell on piano.
