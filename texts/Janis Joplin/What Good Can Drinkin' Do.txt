What good can drinkin' do, what good can drinkin' do ?
Lord, I drink all night but the next day I still feel blue.

There's a glass on the table, they say it's gonna ease all my pain,
And there's a glass on the table, they say it's gonna ease all my pain.
But I drink it down, an' the next day I feel the same.

Gimme whiskey, gimme bourbon, give me gin.
Oh, gimme whiskey, give me bourbon, gimme gin.
'cause it don't matter what I'm drinkin', lord, as long as it drown this sorrow I'm in.

I start drinking friday, I start drinking friday night.
Lord, I start drinking friday, start drinking friday night.
But then I wake up on sunday, child, there ain't nothin' that's right.

My man he left me, child, he left me here.
Yeah, my good man left me, went away and left me here.
Lord, I'm feelin' lowdown, just give me another glass of beer.

What good can drinkin' do, what good can drinkin' do ?
Well, I drink all night but the next day I still feel blue!!!
