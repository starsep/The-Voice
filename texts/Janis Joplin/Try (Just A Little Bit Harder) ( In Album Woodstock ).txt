This is a song called Try (Just a Little Bit Harder) you know you'd better baby and you know you got to
Try, try, try just a little bit harder
So I can love, love, love him, I tell myself
Well, I'm gonna try, just a little bit harder
So I can't give, give, give, give him to nobody else.
Well, I've been waiting for such a long time
I ain't gonna lose myself
(No, I ain't gonna lose it)
I ain't gonna lose myself
To make him mine, all mine.
Yeah, I'm gonna try yeah, just a little bit harder
So I can give, give, give, give him every bit of my soul. (Hey!)
Yeah, I'm gonna try yeah, just a little bit harder
So I won't lose, lose, lose him to nobody, no.
Oh! Well, I don't care how long it's gonna take me
But if it's a dream I don't want
No, I don't really want it
If it's a dream I don't want
Nobody to wake me.
Hey, you better not do it! Yeah!
Try yeah, try oh yeah, hey, hey!
Try yeah,
Try yeah,
Try yeah.
Try...
Oh daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy
Well, every time I reach out I said baby
I know, know, know I got to try some more.
I said I got to put my arms around you
I said, I said I got to hold my demand.
I said I got to make you understand
Whoa baby, I said I gotta bring you round
Bring you round to the insight of me.
I said try, try, yeah, try, try, try, try.
Whoa try, oh yeah, try oh yeah, hey hey!
Try, oh yeah, try, oh yeah, hey hey!
I gotta talk to my man now,
You know, I gotta work for my man now,
I said, I gotta feel for my man now,
You know I, I gotta work for my man now,
I think-a every day for my man now,
I think-a every day for my man now,
You know it, every way for my baby now.
Oh, try, oh yeah, oh try yeah,
Try yeah, try yeah, hey, hey,
Try, oh yeah, try ah yeah,
Try just a little bit
Harder.
Far out.
