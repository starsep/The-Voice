Summertime, 
time, time, 
Child, the living's easy. 
Fish are jumping out 
And the cotton, Lord, 
Cotton's high, Lord, so high. 

Your daddy's rich 
And your ma is so good-looking, baby. 
She's looking good now, 
Hush, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, 
No, no, no, no, don't you cry. 
Don't you cry! 

One of these mornings 
You're gonna rise, rise up singing, 
You're gonna spread your wings, 
Child, and take, take to the sky, 
Lord, the sky. 

But until that morning 
Honey, n-n-nothing's going to harm you now, 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
Don't you cry, 
Cry. 

Piece of My Heart 

Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on! 

Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man -yeah! 
Didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can ? 
Honey, you know I did! 
And each time I tell myself that I, well I think I've had enough, 
But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough. 

I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it, 
Take it! 
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby! 
Oh, oh, break it! 
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah, 
yeah. 
Oh, oh, have a! 
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, 
You know you got it if it makes you feel good, 
Oh, yes indeed. 

You're out on the streets looking good, 
And baby deep down in your heart I guess you know that it ain't 
right, 
Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at 
night, 
Babe, I cry all the time! 
And each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain, 
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again. 

I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it! 
Take it! 
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby. 
Oh, oh, break it! 
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, 
Oh, oh, have a! 
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, 
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good. 

I need you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it, 
Take it! 
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby! 
oh, oh, break it! 
Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, c'mon 
now. 
oh, oh, have a 
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby. 
You know you got it -whoahhhhh!! 

Take it! 
Take it! Take another little piece of my heart now, baby, 
Oh, oh, break it! 
Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, yeah, 
yeah, yeah, 
Oh, oh, have a 
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, hey, 
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good.
