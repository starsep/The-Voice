Work me, Lord,
Work me, Lord.
Please don't you leave me,
I feel so useless down here
With no one to love
Though I've looked everywhere
And I can't find me anybody to love,
To feel my care.
So ah Lord, work me, Lord,
Whoa, oh use me Lord,
Can't I show how hard it is
Trying to live when you're all alone.
Every day I keep trying to move forward,
But something is driving me, oh, back,
Something's trying to hold on to me,
To my way of life.
So, oh don't you forget me down here, Lord,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Ah, don't you forget me, Lord.
Well I don't think I'm any very special
Kind of person down here, I know better,
But I don't think you're gonna find anybody,
Not anybody who can say that they tried like I tried,
The worst that you can say all about me
Is that I'm never satisfied, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, oh, oh, work me, Lord,
Oh daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, use me, Lord.
Please, honey, don't you leave me,
I feel so useless down here.
I can't find me anybody to love me
And I've looked around,
I've looked everywhere, everywhere
And I can't find me anyone to love,
To feel my care.
So honey don't you go and leave me, Lord,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Oh, Lord.
Can't I show you how hard it is
Trying to live when you're all alone.
Every day I keep pushing,
I keep trying to move forward
But something is driving me, oh, back,
Something's trying to hold on to me,
To my way of life, why.
Oh, please, oh whoa, oh whoa.
Oh please, please don't you go and forget me, Lord
Now don't forget me, Lord
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, please, oh daddy, no, no, no, no, please, ah,
Oh no, no, no, no, don't you go and leave me,
Honey I wanna reach out, I wanna
I said I wanna hold on to you
Well, you're never there
You don't turn me off, man,
I said reach out to hold on to my man
I said daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy,
Don't you go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Honey don't you leave me
I said when I wanted to pay now
Oh daddy when I want to leave me now
Don't you go and leave, leave, leave
I'm talkin' to my, my man, yeah!
And my man
Ask my daddy now now
If that's what my daddy wants
I said don't you leave
Oh, I said my love.
Thank you very much.
