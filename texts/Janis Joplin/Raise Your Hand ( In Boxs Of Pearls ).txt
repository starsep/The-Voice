Great, great broad, miss Janis Joplin, please!
If there's something you need,
Hon that you've never, ever, ever had.
And I know you've never had it.
Oh, honey, don't you just sit there crying,
Don't just sit there feeling bad.
No, no, no.
You'd better get up,
Now, don't you understand ?
And raise you hand.
I said, raise, raise your hand.
You know I'm standing about, yes I am.
And I want to give you all my love.
Oh, won't you open up,
I said, open up your heart.
Please let me try.
You'd better be good.
Don't ya understand ?
Raise your hand.
I said, I wanna see it up in the air, babe,
Right here, right now, yeah!
Whoaaaah, yeah!
If you ever, ever need me,
Honey why won't you come and tell me so now ?
Baby if you want to give all of my loving,
I want to let it go.
