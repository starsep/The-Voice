Hey, come on, come on, come on, come on

Didn't I make you feel, oh honey, like you were the only man
I ever wanted, that I ever needed?
Ohh, honey, didn't I give you nearly everything
That I ever had to give? Oh, you know I did
But each time I'll tell myself that I think I've had enough worth
I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough

Want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break another little bit of my heart, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah
Have a, have a another little piece of my heart, daddy, daddy, daddy
You know you got it, if it makes you feel good, yes indeed, woh

You're out on the streets, you're looking good
Honey, deep down inside I know, you know it ain't never been right
Never, never, never hear me cry at night, oh
Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again

Say, "Come on, come on, yeah, come on, come on and take it"
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break another little piece of my heart, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Have another little piece of my heart, baby, baby, baby
You know you got it, if it makes you feel good
I want you to feel good now, yeah

Say, "Come on, come on, come on, come on and take it"
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break another little piece of my heart, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Have a, have a another little piece of my heart, baby, baby, baby
You know you got it, alright

Another little piece of my heart now, daddy
Break it, break it, break it, I want you to want it, take out the inside of me
Have a, have another little piece of my heart , baby, baby, baby
You know you got it, if it makes you
I want you to feel good, now, right now, yeah
