Summertime,
Child, you're living easy.
Fish are, fish are jumping out
And the cotton, Lord,
Cotton's high, Lord, so high.
Your daddy's rich,
When your ma, oh honey thinks she's mighty good-looking, babe.
I said she's looking pretty fine to me right now,
Don't you know she is.
Whoa, hush, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,
No, no, no, no, no, don't you cry.
Oh honey you'd better not cry
'Cause they're gonna kick you up if when you want to do nothing,
Take it from me!
Cry.
Whoa, one of these mornings,
Child, you'll rise up singing, baby, oh.
I said you're gonna wanna go, honey, spread your wings,
Yeah, child, you take, take to the sky,
Lord, the sky.
Until that morning,
Honey, no-no-no-nothing's going to harm you, babe,
I said honey nothing's ever gonna let you down,
'Cause I just wouldn't let them do it , no, no, no, no, no,
Hush, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,
No, no, no, no, no,
Don't you cry, oh no,
Cry.
