Summertime, time, time,
Child, the livings easy.
Fish are jumping out
And the cotton, lord,
Cottons high, lord, so high.

Your daddys rich
And your ma is so good-looking, baby.
Shes looking good now,
Hush, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't you cry.
Aahhhh!

One of these mornings
Youre gonna rise, rise up singing,
Youre gonna spread your wings,
Child, and take, take to the sky,
Lord, the sky.

Until that morning
Honey, n-n-nothings going to harm you now,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Don't you cry,
Don't you cry,
Cry.
