Hey, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Didn't I make you feel, oh honey, like you were the only man I ever wanted, that I ever needed ?
Oh ho, honey, didn't I give you nearly everything that I ever had to give ?
Oh, you know I did!
And each time I tell myself that I think I've had enough,
Well, I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough.
I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it,
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have a, have another little piece of my heart now, daddy daddy daddy,
You know you got it if it makes you feel good,
Yes indeed, whoaa.
You're out on the streets, you're looking good,
Honey, deep down inside I know you know it ain't never been right,
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never hear me cry at night, oh!
Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain,
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again.
Say come on, come on, yeah, come on, come on and take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby.
Break another little piece of my heart, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have another little piece of my heart, baby, baby, baby,
You know you got it, if it makes you feel good.
I want you to feel good now, yeah!!!
Say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it,
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Break another little piece of my heart, darling, yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Have a, have another little piece of my heart, baby, baby, baby.
You know you got it — alright!!!
Say! Whoaa, have another little piece of my heart now, daddy,
Break it, break it, break it, I want you to want it, take out the inside of me,
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, baby, baby.
You know you got it, if it makes you —
I want you to feel good, Lord, alright!!!
Yeah!!
One, two!!
