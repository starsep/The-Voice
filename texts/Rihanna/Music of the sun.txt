Listen closley here the music playin' 
Let take you to place far away and 
Relax your senses just do what you wanna do 
No need for questions it's only for you 

And it's so amazing 
Oh how you can't escape it 
The moment takes you 
Never lets you go 

Can you feel the music in the air 
Let the rise of the rythym take you there 
It doesn't matter who are or where you from 
Come and dance to the music of the sun 
Forget about your trouble's it's alright 
Let em know that you see the morning light 
Hear the beat and the bodies move as one 
Come and dance to the music of the sun 

So real so right 
Can't explain the feelin' 
Like the sun light 
Brings the life new meanin' 
No need for stressin' 
No Not for another day 
No second guessin' 
Just trust me when I say 

And it's so amazing 
Oh how you can't escape it 
The moments takes you and 
Never lets you go 

Can you feel the music in the air 
Let the rise of the rythym take you there 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you from 
Come and dance to the music of the sun 
Forget about your troubles it's alright 
Let em know that you see the morning light 
Hear the beat and the bodies move as one 
Come and dance to the music of the sun 

And it's so amazing 
Oh how you can't escape it 
The moments takes you and 
Never lets you go 

Can you feel the music in the air 
Let the rise of the rythym take you there 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you from 
Come and dance to the music of the sun 
Forget about your troubles it's alright 
Let em know that you see the morning light 
Hear the beat and the bodies move as one 
Come and dance to the music of the sun 

Come and dance to the music of the sun 
Come and dance to the music of the sun 
Come and dance to the music of the sun 
Come and dance to the music of the sun 

Can you feel the music in the air 
Let the rise of the rythym take you there 
It doesn't matter who you are or where you from 
Come and dance to the music of the sun
