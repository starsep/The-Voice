Yeah 
Whoa 
Gunfire left a hole 
In the tank 
Losing gasoline 

Fire is on my trail 
And he's after me 
Hope it don't get here 
Before I get where I'm going 
I gotta get where I'm going 
Take off the masked debris 

You could've been a apart of a 
Masterpiece 
Fluid in the breaks 
Was the last to leak 
Thats the thing 

Where I'm going 
I don't need my breaks 
Cant wait to see your face 
When your front windows break 
And I can crash through 

CHORUS:
The love is near to clear the road 
Oh, oh, oh 
Cause this thing is ready to blow 
Oh, oh, oh 
I just wanna set you on fire 
So I don't have to ride alone 
Then you 
Then you'll know where 
I'm coming from 
Fire bomb 
Fire bomb 

Seats go 
But baby no 
Doesn't have to be 
Like the way that I'm at 
A tragedy 
Watching it burning 
Its beautiful and its blue 
And its pitiful 
And its through 
Its the other half of me 

I didn't do it 
You lit from match from me 
Now were flying 
From the blast, baby 
Thats the thing 

Where were going 
We don't need no breaks 
Cant wait to see your face 
When your front windows break 
And I don't crash through 

CHORUS:
The love is near to clear the road 
Oh, oh, oh 
Cause this thing is ready to blow 
Oh, oh, oh 
I just wanna set you on fire 
So I don't have to ride alone 
Then you 
Then you'll know where 
I'm coming from 
Fire bomb 
Fire bomb 

Baby were working on 
They couldn't handle 
The millionth degree 
We were criminal 
As we were burning 
The world called 
The police 
Fire department 
Ambulance 
You call me crazy 
Cause that was the 
Only move 
For me and you 
To blow our flames 
And 

CHORUS:
The love is near to clear the road 
Oh, oh, oh 
Cause this thing is ready to blow 
Oh, oh, oh 
I just wanna set you on fire 
So I don't have to ride alone 
Then you 
Then you'll know where 
I'm coming from 
Fire bomb 
Fire bomb
