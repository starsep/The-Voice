No no no 
You don't love me and I know now Rihanna 
No no no 
You don't love me so let me go now You

Playas gonna play

Well I know that for myself now

A game that I know all to well now 
Well I use to buy your lines Songtext 
But it's time for me to sail now

Haters gonna hate You

The truth leads to the lies 
The heart aint always right Love 
And I see that love is blind now 
Boy you use to have my trust Me 
Without no trust there aint no us boy
