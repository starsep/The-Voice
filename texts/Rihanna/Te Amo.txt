Te Amo, Te Amo
She says to me, I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra 
She takes the lead
Thats when I saw it in her eyes
It's over

Refren:
Then she said Te Amo 
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, 
She cried Te Amo 
I told her I'm not gonna run away, 
But let me go
My soul is awry, without asking why
I said Te Amo, wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you

Te Amo, Te Amo, she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice uhh
Pull me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why 
It's Over

Refren:
Then she said Te Amo 
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, 
She cried Te Amo 
I told her I'm not gonna run away, 
But let me go
My soul is awry, without asking why
I said Te Amo, wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you

Listen we can dance, but you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night, I'm movin to the light because I understand
That we all need love and I'm not afraid
I feel the love, but I don't feel that way

Refren:
Then she said Te Amo 
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, 
She cried Te Amo 
I told her I'm not gonna run away, 
But let me go
My soul is awry, without asking why
I said Te Amo, wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you

Think it means I love you
I love you
Te amo, te amo
Don't it mean I love you
