Once, far away and long ago was a tale, my daddy told to me...
He said -There's a land of fantasy,
there's a prince who'll fight for me, till the end...

This isn't how I thought I was supposed to be
you were the one who I imagine next to me...
But sometimes love fell in the hands of the wreckless
this is no fairytale and I'm no princess...
No princess...

Now we're living the strangest dream
and I don't know what to believe...
'cause when you said -I'm the one who'll fight for you...
I'm the one that you'll never lose...
That was just to tell...

This isn't how I thought I was supposed to be
you were the one who I imagine next to me...
But sometimes love fell the hands of wreckless
this is no fairytale and I'm no princess...
No princess...

If I'm a prisoner and there is my captor
and I'll never know happily ever after I'm no princess...
That is just how it is but now I'm wiser and next time I'll write my own last chapter...

This isn't how I thought I was supposed to be
you were the one who I imagine next to me...
But sometimes love fell the hands of wreckless
this is no fairytale and I'm no princess...
No princess...
