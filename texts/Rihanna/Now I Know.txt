Hey 
Mmmmhmmm 
No 

Took a chance 
Roll the dice on me and you 
Opened up, let you in my world 
Like a dance 
Started slow and then love took control 
Swept away, so proud to be your girl 

But when you write a story much too fast 
Sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last 

Now I know 
That love ain’t meant to be a play thing 
Now I know 
It’s not an ordinary, every day thing 
Now I know 
That when it’s right it’s so amazing 
But when it’s wrong you got to let it go 
Now I know 
Now I know 

Remember when 
We said our love would last forever 
But then again 
How are we to know 
There’ll come a time 
That love will change like stormy weather 
A sunny day can suddenly turn cold 

Time will teach you all you need to learn 
But there’ll always a be a first time you get burned 

Now I know 
That love ain’t meant to be a play thing 
Now I know 
It’s not an ordinary, every day thing 
Now I know 
That when it’s right it’s so amazing 
But when it’s wrong you got to let it go 
Now I know 
Now I know 
Yeah 

I don’t regret a single day 
They joy and pain along the way 
A broken heart’s the price we pay 
Sad as it may seem 
Baby can’t you see 
It’s the way it’s got to be 

Now I know 
That love ain’t meant to be a play thing 
Now I know 
It’s not an ordinary, every day thing 
Now I know 
That when it’s right it’s so amazing 
But when it’s wrong you got to let it go 
Now I know 
Now I know 
Yeah 
Now I know 
I know
