Boy it feels like torture, that's so bad I want you now, now, now
When your body's near me, I just wanna lay him down, down, down
Let's find a private corner, oh, a pussy for this crown, crown, crown
Cause this grinding and this kissing got me wondering what I'm missing
Right now, now, now

If we don't touch, it be the death of us
It be the death of us
If I don't taste your blow it be the death of us
If we don't touch, it be the death of us
It be the death of us
If I don't taste your blow it be the death of us
So come on, on

God I'm feeling all tonight
Tease me, take me, get me high
If we don't touch, it be the death of us
It be the death of us

I'll let you be my daddy, if you come make mama proud, proud, proud
Let's find a private corner, oh, a pussy for this crown, crown, crown
Cause this grinding and this kissing got me wondering what I'm missing
right now, now, now

If we don't touch, it be the death of us
It be the death of us
If I don't taste your blow it be the death of us
If we don't touch, it be the death of us
It be the death of us
If I don't taste your blow it be the death of us
So come on, on

God I'm feeling all tonight
Tease me, take me, get me high
If we don't touch, it be the death of us
It be the death of us

Give me mouth to mouth, let them freaking out
Cause boy you already know, eh

If we don't touch
If I don't taste your blow
Come on
If we don't touch, it be the death of us,
It be the death of us
If I don't taste your blow it be the death of us
So come on, on

God I'm feeling all tonight
Tease me, take me, get me high
If we don't touch, it be the death of us
It be the death of us
