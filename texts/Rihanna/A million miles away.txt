Here we lay face to face once again
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend.
and Im wondering who will be to first to say what we both know
We're just holding on to could have beens and we should be letting go.

[Chorus:]
It feels like your a million miles away as your lying hee with me tonight. I cant even fine the words to
say I can find a way to make it right. and we both know that the stories ending, we play the part but
we're just pretending and I cant hide the tears cause even though your here, it feels like your a million
miles away.

Was it me, or was it you that broke away? for what we were is like a season love is change and every
time I think about it, it tears me up inside. Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry.

[Chorus:]

[Music Plays:]

[Bridge]

We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before, while our song is playing its last note, we
both know for sure that its time to close that door.

[Chorus:]
