What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel like this?
I'm going crazy now...

No more gas, in the red
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
I'm alive, I'm ahead
Don't wanna think about it
Feels like I'm going insane

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind it can control you
It's too close for comfort

Put on your pretty lies
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't goin' play it nice
Watch out you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scarin' you tonight?
Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they're talkin' to me
Disconnected, no call
The phone don't even ring
I gotta get up or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort, ohhh

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind it can control you
I feel like a monster, ohh

Put on your pretty lies
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't goin' play it nice
Watch out you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scarin' you tonight?
Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

Disturbia...

Release me from this curse I'm in
Tryin' to maintain but I'm struggling
If you can't go
Think I'm gonna, ahhh

Put on your pretty lies
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't goin' play it nice
Watch out you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scarin' you tonight?
Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia
