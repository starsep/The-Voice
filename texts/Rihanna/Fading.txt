You say you love me
But they feel like words to me
But this just ain't working
Stop thinking
You can run over me
Drifting, settling of to a foreign place
If I can't see what's in front of me
It's a mystery
Well than apparently

Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone, bye-bye, so long

Can't you see that you're fading
Fading, fading, fa-a-a-ading 
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes
And I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Put a sock in it
Just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up
I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
'Cause I'm so fed up
Boy you got me messed up
If you hit me back up
Don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away

Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone, ta ta, so long

Can't you see that you're fading
Fading, fading, fa-a-a-ading 
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes
And I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Saw you turn into a ghost
Right in front of my eyes
Tell me what's a girl to do
When she's crying inside
I'm about to go insane
I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong of right
I'll be gone by night

Can't you see that you're fading
Fading, fading, fa-a-a-ading
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes
And I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away
