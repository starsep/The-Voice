We break, break (REPEAT X2)
We break em' down
We break, break (REPEAT X2)
We break em' down

It's getting later baby and I'm getting curious
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
Coz the beat penetrates my body
Shaking inside my bones
And you pushing all my buttons
Taking me outta my zone, yeah

The way that you stare starts the fire in me
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

I wish you would push up on me 
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me, push up on me (REPEAT)

I know many guys just like ya, extremely confident
Got so much flavour with ya, like you're the perfect man
You wanna make me chase ya, like it's a compliment
Well let's get right down to it, I can be the girl
That'll break you down

The way that you stare starts the fire in me
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

I wish you would push up on me 
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me, push up on me (REPEAT)

We break, break (REPEAT X2)
We break em' down
We break, break (REPEAT X2)
We break em' down

I wanna see how you move it, show me, show me how ya do it
You really gotta me on it, I must confess, I must confess
Baby there ain't nothing to it, baby who you think you're fooling
You wanna come and get me outta my dress

The way that you stare starts the fire in me
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

I wish you would push up on me 
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me, push up on me (REPEAT)

We break, break (REPEAT X2)
We break em' down
We break, break (REPEAT X2)
We break em' down
