Dear Diary,
I must relate you all my life
There where I live, I die
In the future, I would try
To don't be more shy
That's here when I must
Tell my feelings and push
For trying to find the door
Who could stop my fuss

When I must note my life
I often give it three pounts five
I'm sorry babe, but it's the time
To leave away 'cause I must die
When I must note my life
I often give it three pounts five

Once Again,
I have enough to hear
A lot of lies next my ear
That's for this I name you dear
Instead to insult you as the teenagers
I'd want wipe from the world
Not anymore waitin' on the door
Not anymore sufferin' anymore
But...
...Understand why I'm the clue

When I must note my life
I often give it three pounts five
I'm sorry babe, but it's the time
To leave away 'cause I must die
When I must note my life
I often give it three pounts five

I have enough
I want wipe
Of the world
Not anymore respectin' the rules
Who do of this world a rip

When I must note my life
I often give it three pounts five
I'm sorry babe, but it's the time
To leave away 'cause I must die
When I must note my life
I often give it three pounts five
