[Adam]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I’m not your type, But I can make you sway.
It makes you burn to learn, you’re not the only one
I’d let you be if you put down your blazing gun.

[Rihanna]
Now you’ve gone somewhere else, Far away
I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you).
But you feel my breath, on your neck
Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you).

[Both]
‘Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before

[Rihanna]
And if I never see your face again, I don’t mind

[Both]
Cause we got much further than I thought we’d get tonight

[Rihanna]
Sometimes you move so well
It’s hard not to give in.

[Adam]
I’m lost, I can’t tell
Where you end, where I begin.

[Rihanna]
It makes you burn to learn
I’m with another man.

[Adam]
I wonder if he’s half
The lover that I am.

[Adam]
Now you’ve gone somewhere else, Far away
I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you).
But you feel my breath, on your neck
Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you).

[Both]
‘Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before

[Rihanna]
If I never see your face again, I don’t mind

[Both]
‘Cause we got much further than I thought we’d get tonight

[Adam]
Baby, baby
Please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)

[Rihanna]
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don’t deceive me
Talk to me bout taking your time
(Talk to me, talk to me)

[Rihanna]
‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before

[Both]
If I never see your face again, I don’t mind
‘Cause we got much further than I thought we’d get tonight (talk to me, talk to me)

[Both]
‘Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before (Did before)
And if I never see your face again, I don’t mind
‘Cause we got much further than I thought we’d get tonight.
