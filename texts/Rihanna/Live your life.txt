(Feat. T.I.)

Rihanna:
You're gonna be a shining star,
And fancy cars, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see,
You're gonna go far.
Cause everyone knows,
Who you are-are.
So live your life, ay ay ay.
Instead of chasing that paper.
Just live your life (Oh! ),
Ay ay ay.
You got no time for no inters.
Just live your life (Oh! ),
Ay ay ay.
No telling where it'll take you.
Just live your life (Oh! ),
Ay ay ay.
Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life.

T.I.:
I'm the opposite of moderate,
Immaculately polished
With the spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid.
Allergic to the counterfeit,
Impartial to the politics.
Articulate
But still would grab a nigga
By the collar quick.
Whoever had problems,
They reckonsile
They just holla 'til.
If that don't work
And just fails,
Then turn around and follow 'til.
I got love for the game
But ay
I'm not in love with all of it.
I do without the fame
And the rappers nowadays are comedy.
The hootin' and the hollerin',
Back and forth with the argueing.

Where you from, who you know,
What you make
And what kind of car you in.
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important
With the positive.
And checks
Until your bank account,
And you're about poverted.
Your values is a disarrayed,
Prioritized are horribly.
Unhappy with the riches
Cause you pis-pone morraly.
Ignoring all prior advice
And fore warning.
And we might be
Full of ourselves
All of a sudden aren't we?

Rihanna:
You're gonna be
A shining star,
And fancy cars,
Fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see,
You're gonna go far.
Cause everyone knows,
Who you are-are.
So live your life,
Ay ay ay.
Instead of chasing that paper.
Just live your life (Oh! ),
Ay ay ay.
You got no time for no inters.
Just live your life (Oh! ),
Ay ay ay.
No telling
Where it'll take you.
Just live your life (Oh! ),
Ay ay ay.
Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life (ay),
My life (oh),
My life (ay),
My life (oh)
Just living my life (ay),
My life (oh),
My life (ay),
My life (oh)

So live your life.
