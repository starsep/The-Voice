Boy your standin real close to me 
tell me now what's it gonna be

Backn forth 
baby round n round 
so high that i can't can't come down 
it's too late to turn back now 
still i'm scared to lose control 
feel the heat burnin like the sun 
feel the beat as we move as one 
don't stop till the night is done 
hold me close boy

still i got to know if this is real or just a dream 
because in the mornin my true love is what i wanna see
