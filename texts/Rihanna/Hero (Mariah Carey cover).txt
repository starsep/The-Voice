mmmmm

HERO
There's a hero,
If you look inside your heart,
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are.
There's an answer,
If you reach into your soul,
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away


And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside,
And you Know you can't survive.
So when you feel like hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lies in you.

It's a long road,
When you face the world alone,
No one reaches out a hand,
For you to hold.
You can find love,
If you search within yourself,
And that emptiness you felt,
Will disappear.

CHORUS
And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside,
And you know you can't survive.
So when you feel like hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lies in you.

(Ohhhhhh) Lord knows,
Dreams are hard to follow.
But don't let anyone tear them away (hey yeah).
Hold on,
There will be tomorrow.
In time you'll find the way.

REPEAT CHORUS

That a hero lies in
...you...

mmmm

That a hero lies in
...you...
