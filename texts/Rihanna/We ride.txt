Ride 
When we ride, we ride, its till the day 
That we die..x2 

[Verse 1] 
Its real late about a quarter to 1 
And I'm thinkin of everything we've become 
And I hate it, I thought we could make it 
But I'm ready to dead this 
Just wanna forget about it 
I saw the pictures n the letters she sent 
You had me thinkin you were out 
With ya friends, I'm so foolish 
Played me like I'm stupid 
Cuz I thought it was just you and I 

[Bridge] 
Now I look back on the time that we spent 
And I, see it in my mind 
Playin over and over again.. 
It's pourin down, you got me breakin down 
And I just cant figure out why 
But this is what you said 

[Chorus] 
When we ride 
When we ride, we ride 
It's till the day that we die 
We used to say 
When we ride 
When we ride, we ride 
It's till the day that we die 
When we ride... 
I remember what ya used to say 
When we ride 
When we ride, we ride 
It's till the day that we die.. 

[Verse 2] 
Visions in my mind of the day that we met 
You showed me things that 
I'll never forget 
Took me swimin in the ocean 
You had my head up in the clouds 
Made me feel like im floatin..yea 
To the think of it 
When you know its the truth 
Nobody else can do it quite like I do 
All my kisses n my lovin 
Aint nobody better then us..yea 

Bridge] 
Now I look back on the time that we spent 
And I, see it in my mind 
Playin over and over again.. 
It's pourin down, you got me breakin down 
And I just cant figure out why 
But this is what you said 

Chorus] 
When we ride 
When we ride, we ride 
It's till the day that we die 
We used to say 
When we ride 
When we ride, we ride 
It's till the day that we die 
When we ride... 
I remember what ya used to say 
When we ride 
When we ride, we ride 
It's till the day that we die.. 

I guess its over indeffinatley 
But you and I kno 
It's not that easy to let go of everything 
That we had and start all over again 
Just blame yourself cuz you blew it 
I wont forget how you do it 
My sweet baby this is where the game ends 
Now, somehow, wanna believe 
You and me we can figure it out 

[Chorus] 
When we ride 
When we ride, we ride 
It's till the day that we die 
Oh boy, I wish that you could hold me 
When I'm lonely when I need someone 
To talk to, you were phoney 
Just like everything you told me 
When we ride 
When we ride, we ride 
It's till the day that we die 
Boy, you forget about the promises 
Made me, and now I let the memories 
Fade away, but I rememeber what 
You used to say 
When we ride... 
I remember what ya used to say 
When we ride, we ride 
It's till the day that we die.. 
We ride..when we ride, we ride 
It's till the day that we die..
