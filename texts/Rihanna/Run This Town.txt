Feel it coming in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the the thrill (I'm ready)
It's a dangerous love affair (c'mon)
Can't be scaring nickels down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who gonna run this town tonight
Is who gonna run this town tonight
We gonna run this town

[Jay-Z]
We are, yeah, I said it, we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds, riding with they Dillingers
I get more in-depth if you boys really real enough
This is La Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' get back
I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talking five comma six zeroes dot zero circa
Back to running circles 'round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up

[Rihanna]
Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doing my own thing
Walking tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who gonna run this town tonight

Heeeeeeeeey heeeeeeay
Heeeeeeeeey heeeeeeay
Who gonna run this town tonight?

[Jay-Z]
We are, yeah, I said it, we are
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are
Microphone fiend, it's the return of the God, peace God
And ain't nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, uh, Martin Margiela
On the table, screaming fuck the other side, they jealous
We got a Bankhead full of broads, they got a table full of fellas
And they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw they hand in, 'cause they ain't got no spades
My whole team got dough
So my Bankhead is lookin' like Millionaires' Row

[Rihanna]
Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doing my own thing
Walking tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who gonna run this town tonight

Heeeeeeeeey heeeeeeay
Heeeeeeeeey heeeeeeay
Who gonna run this town tonight?

[Kanye West]
It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick, no homo
I bought my whole family whips, no Volvos
Next time I'm in church, please no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This a fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for? To push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I could spend my whole life good will hunting
Only good gon' come is it's good when I'm coming
She got an ass that'll swallow up her G-string
And up top, uh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting, off the re-sling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that you do bring
I'm just tryin' change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoestrings?
What's that, Ye? Baby, these heels
Is that a May-what? Baby, these wheels
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you run it, huh?
Now you know how we feel

[Jay-Z]
Wha'sup?

[Rihanna]
Heeeeeeeeey heeeeeeay
Heeeeeeeeey heeeeeeay

[Jay-Z]

[Rihanna]
Heeeeeeeeey heeeeeeay

We gonna run this town tonight

[Jay-Z]
Wha'sup?
