(Akon)
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
Ey

(Rihanna)
I was pickin' up your clothes in the closet (closet)
I was bout' to throw your jeans in the washer (washer)
Til I saw a piece of paper sayin' "Tasha" (Tasha)
I gotta say I found this a bit shockin'
And some reciepts here that say you went shoppin'
You bought some Nike shoes
But why you buyin stockings?
Boy how could you lie to me?
I thought you would die for me
I'm not accepting another apology.

(Chorus)
After three years, I'ma let it go
Can't stand around cryin' no more
Got your bags packed sittin' by the door
I'ma leave you heart broken on the floor
You gonna be in the Emergency Room
I’m standing by your bed
And searching t-to pull out your IV
You gonna be in the Emergency Room
I'm fightin' with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You gonna be in the Emergency Room
Tryin' to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat?
Flat line on the E-K-G
Well I was home late at night watchin' TV
Got a call from my girl sayin' "RiRi
Saw your man in the club
I thought he was out of town doin' business
Said that he'd be back in three weeks"
Now I'm mad (mad)
Sittin' in the kitchen gettin sad (sad)
Lookin' at your pictures
Boy how could you lie to me?
I thought you would die for me
I'm not accepting another apology.

(Chorus)
After three years, I'ma let it go
Can't stand around cryin' no more
Got your bags packed sittin' by the door
I'ma leave you heart broken on the floor
You gonna be in the Emergency Room
I’m standing by your bed
And searching t-to pull out your IV
You gonna be in the Emergency Room
I'm fightin' with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You gonna be in the Emergency Room
Tryin' to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat?
Flat line on the E-K-G

I did you wrong girl (I did)
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone girl (I did)
But we been in this relationship to long girl
For you to be listening to your silly home girls
Better go on girl
Now baby think about it
Everything we gonna do they gonna read about it
Put it on the radio and TV outlet
Do you wanna see your picture in that paper?
You know them haters...
You hear that 808
The drum... that's my heartbeat
I'm going numb
I said Rihanna, I'm feelin stressed
I'm goin under cardiac arrest

(Rihanna)
You gonna be in the Emergency Room
I’m standing by your bed
And searching t-to pull out your IV
You gonna be in the Emergency Room
I'm fightin' with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You gonna be in the Emergency Room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat?
Flat line on the E-K-G
