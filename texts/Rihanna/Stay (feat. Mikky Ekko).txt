Rihanna:
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot had a believer
I threw my hands in the air I said show me something
He said if you dare come a little closer

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

Mikky Ekko:
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
Now I want you to stay

Rihanna, Mikky Ekko:
Ohhh, the reason I hold on
Ohhh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but 
I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light 
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Rihanna:
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move

Rihanna, Mikky Ekko:
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way

Rihanna:
I want you to stay
Stay

Rihanna, Mikky Ekko:
I want you to stay
Ohhh
