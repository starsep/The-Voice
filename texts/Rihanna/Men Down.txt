I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Before I end up behind bars

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam
Man down
Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam
Man down

Oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot, a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh why? Oh why?
Oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station

It's a 22
I call her "Peggy Sue"
When she fits right down in my shoes
What do you expect me to do
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my firearm

I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam
Man down
Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam
Man down

Oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh why? Oh why?
Oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station

Hear me now
Look, I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Oh gosh
Whatever happened to me
Ever happened to me
Ever happened to me
Why did I pull the trigger?
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger - BOOM!
And end a nigga's, end a nigga's life so soon
When me pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull it 'pon you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do

Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam
Me say one man down (a weh me say)
Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam. Rum pa pa pam
And me went downtown

'Cause now I am a criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh Lord have mercy, now I am a criminal
Man down
Tell the judge please give me minimal
Run out a town none of them can see me now

Oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh why? Oh why?
Oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station

oh aj jaj
