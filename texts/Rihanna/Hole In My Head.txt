You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl

[Rihanna]
No use, Your lips keep moving
But i got a couple screws loose
Them other boys talkin, bout me
They say im that miss, and
Probably best for you to keep this short
Its my time to interupt, Its time to start me up

[Bridge]
I don't think you wanna do that right now
And not with me, Don't start with me i got a gun on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
I gotta feeling, I'll burn it down, I'll burn you down

All over your radio, see me in the stadium
I'll spin your body, Let these ladies know
Don't bring this hoe around me
Don't push my buttons
You don't really wanna see me get fired up
Wanna see me get wild

[Chorus]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes i get crazy and
I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny
Like you ain't hear what i said
I gotta hole in my head
ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Don't look at me funny
Like you aint hear what i said
ay ay ay i gotta hole in my head

In the parking lot, I ride this like a fast car
Suck it up, Dont even try to act hard
And you can try to run But you won,t get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you,
you got a hole in your head too
And I knew it but I let my screws loose
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Really take a lot to work me up

[Bridge]
I don't think you wanna do that right now
And not with me, Dont start with me i got a attitude on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
I gotta feeling, I'll burn it down, I'll burn you downnn

Catch me on your mind baby
Don't waste my time baby
Now watch me wind
You can take that as a sign baby
So left and right baby
So push my buttons
You see me get wild
Uh go wild baby

[Chorus]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes i get crazy and
I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny
Did you hear what i said
I gotta hole in my head
ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Don't look at me funny
Like you aint heard what i said
ay ay ay i gotta hole in my head

uh ohh uh ohh
Sometimes I go crazy
uh ohh uh ohh
Watch me Watch me
uh ohh uh ohh
Sometimes I go crazy

[Justin Timberlake]
Break it down

I hear voices in my head they go oo ohh ooooo x6

[Rihanna]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes i get crazy and
I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny
Did you hear what i said
I gotta hole in my head
ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Don't look at me funny
Like you aint heard what i said
ay ay ay i gotta hole in my head

[Justin Timberlake]
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
