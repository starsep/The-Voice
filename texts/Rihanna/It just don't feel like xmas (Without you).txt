Ohhh
Another day
Another reminder
That you're not here with me
I watched the snowflakes
Falling from the sky
I get lost in memories
The time we tried
To build a snowman
The time we tried
To count the stars
It's crazy
How we didn't know that
That we'd ever be apart

Chorus:
I can hear the music playing
See the lights up on the tree
I can feel the joy
In every soul
But for me it's incomplete
And I try my best
To play the part
But no matter what I do
No, it just don't feel
Like christmas without you
You, you, you, no

Another tear
Another regret, boy
But you're so far away
Can it be
That it was only last year
Shared that christmas day
Remember when we took
The slay ride
Remember singing by the fire
There's a in a daylight
I keep reliving you, and I

I can hear the music playing
See the lights up on the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me it's incomplete
And I try my best
To play the part
But no matter what I do
No, it just don't feel
Like Christmas
No, it just don't feel
Like Christmas without you

The time we tried
To build a snowman
The time we tried
To count the stars
It's crazy
How we didn't know
That
That we'd ever be apart

I can hear the music playing
See the lights up on the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me it's incomplete
And I try my best
To play the part
But no matter what I do
No, it just don't feel
Like Christmas
No, it just don't feel
Like Christmas without you

No baby
See I tried
I just did
Right without you
