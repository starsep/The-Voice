[Intro] 
Lalala, lalala, lalalalala, Ohhh (You know, I never felt like this before)
Lalala, lalala, lalalalala, Ohhh (This feeling's like so real)

[Verse 1] 
I'm obessive when just one thought of you comes up 
I'm aggressive cause just one thought ain't close enough 
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
Cause every moment gone you know I miss you 
I'm the question and you're of course the answer 
Just hold me close boy cause I'm your tiny dancer 
You make me shaken up I'm never mistaken 
but I can't control myself, got me calling out for Help 

[Chorus] 
S-O-S please someone help me. 
It's not healthy for me to feel this 
Y-O-U are making this hard? 
I can't take it see it don't feel right. 
S-O-S please someone help me, 
It's not healthy for me to feel this 
Y-O-U are making this hard?
You got me tossing and turning can't sleep at night 

[Bridge] 
This time please someone come and rescue me 
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it 
I'm lost, you got me lookin for the rest of me 
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me 
'cause you or my mind has got me losing it, 
I'm lost you got me looking for the rest of me, 
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it. 

[Verse 2] 
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity, 
yes it's a lesson and it's unfair, you stole my vanity 
My tummy's up in knots, and when i see ya it gets so hot 
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock 
Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight!
I melt with you, ya got me head over heels, (over heels)
boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel

[Chorus] 
S-O-S, please someone help me. 
It's not healthy for me to feel this 
Y-O-U are making this hard? 
You got me tossing and turning can't sleep at night.

[Bridge] 
This time please someone come and rescue me 
'cause you or my mind has got me losing it 
I'm lost, you got me lookin for the rest of me 
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please some one come and rescue me 
'cause you or my mind has got me losing it, 
I'm lost you got me looking for the rest of me, 
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it. 

[Verse 3:]
Boy you know you got me feeling open and 
Boy our loves enough with words unspoken 
I said BOY I'm telling you, you got me open, 
I don't know what to do it's true, I'm going crazy over you, 
I'm begging 

[Chorus] 
S-O-S, please someone help me (somebody help me)

Y-O-U are making this hard? 
You got me tossing and turning can't sleep at night.

[Bridge] 
This time please someone come and rescue me 
cause you or my mind has got me losing it 
I'm lost, you got me lookin for the rest of me 
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please some one come and rescue me 
'cause you or my mind has got me losing it, 
I'm lost you got me looking for the rest of me, 
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it.
