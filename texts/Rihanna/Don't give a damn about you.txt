What do I do?
It doesn't make sense.
Can I run away?
Did he have to change his mind?
Why he break my heart?
What will my friends say?
Why do I love him anyway?
Didn't I give him everything?
Where did I go wrong?

And I don't understand,
Why did he tell lies,
Why did he waste my time?
How could he play games with my heart?

And this is how I feel.
I can't believe but I know this is real.
What do you say when he don't give a damn about you?
Don't give a damn about you.
Don't give a damn about you.
Don't give a damn about you.
Don't give a damn.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

Wish that I knew..
Don't he get I'm not just a game to play?
I'm about to loose my mind.
I let him break my heart.
This is so crazy!
I don't really love him anyway..
He never gave me anything.
He did me so wrong.

And I don't understand,
Why did he tell lies,
Why did he waste my time?
How could he play games with my heart?

And this is how I feel.
I can't believe but I know this is real.
