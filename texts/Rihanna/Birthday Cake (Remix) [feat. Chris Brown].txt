Blowing out your candles, let me make a couple wishes

(Rihanna)

Remember how you did it?
Remember how you fit it?
If you still wanna kiss it
Come, c-come and get it
Sweeter than a rice cake, cake worth sipping
Kill it, tip it, cake fill it

If you sexy and you know it
And you ain’t afraid to show it
Put a candle on my motherfucking back baby blow it
Love the way you do when you do it like that
Show up with the stats, bring the racks on my racks
Wrap it up, wrap it up boy
While I take this bow off
Top that talk yeah I know I’m such a show off
Daddy make a wish
Put this cake in your face
And it’s not even my birthday

(Chris Brown)
