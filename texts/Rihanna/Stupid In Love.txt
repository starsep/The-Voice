Stupid in love
Oh
Stupid in love

Let me tell you something
Never have I ever
Been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see
What you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right

So I made it
Even though Katy
Told me this would be nothing
But a waste of time
And she was right

Don't understand it
Blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just can't do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid

My new nickname
Is "you idiot" (Such an idiot)
That's what my friends
Are calling me when
They see me yelling
Into my phone

They're telling me "let go,
He is not the one"
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it
Not like you want it
Scheming and cheating
Oh girl, why do you waste your time
You know he ain't right

Telling me this
I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just can't do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid

Tryin' to make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?

Ooh
No
No
No
I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just can't do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid

I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid
In love...
