Here we lay face to face once again 
the silence cuts like a knife as we pretend 
and i'm wonderin who will be the first 
to say what we both know 
we're just holding on to 'could have beens' 
when we should be lettin' go 

it feels like you're a million miles away 
as your lyin' here with me tonight 
and i can't even find the words to say 
i can't find a way to make it right 
and we both know that the story's ending 
we play the part but we're just pretendin' 
and i can't hide the tears 
cause even though your here 
it feels like you a million miles away 

was it me or was it you that broke away 
what we were was like the seasons 
love has changed 
and everytime i think about it 
it tears me up inside 
???? of emotions 
but i got no more tears to cry 

it feels like you're a million miles away 
as your lyin' here with me tonight 
and i can't even find the words to say 
i can't find a way to make it right 
and we both know that the story's ending 
we play the part but we're just pretendin' 
and i can't hide the tears 
cause even though your here 
it feels like you a million miles away 

we can try to talk it over 
but we've walked that road before 
boy our song has played its last note 
and we both know for sure 
that it's time to close that door 

it feels like you're a million miles away 
as your lyin' here with me tonight 
i can't even find the words to say 
i can't find a way to make it right 
we both know that the story's ending 
we play the part but we're just pretendin' 
and i can't hide the tears 
cause even though your here 
it feels like you a million miles away 
yeah, a million miles away
