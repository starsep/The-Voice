Please don't stop the music (4x)

It's gettin late, 
I'm making my way over to my favorite place, 
I gotta get my body moving shake the stress away, 
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way, 
Possible candidate yeah
Who knew, 
That youd be up here lookin like you do, 
You're making staying over here impossible, 
Baby I must say your aura is incredible, 
If you dont have to go don't

Bridge:
Do you know what youv started, 
I just came here to party, 
But now wer rockin on the dancefloor acting naughty, 
Your hands around my waist, 
Just let the music play, 
We're hand in hand, 
Chest to chest, 
And now we're face to face

Chorus:
I wanna take you away, 
Lets escape into the music DJ let it play,
I just can't refuse it, 
Like the way you do this, 
Keep on rockin to it, 
Please don't stop the, 
Please don't stop the, 
Please don't stop the music 
(Repeat)


Baby are you ready cause its getting close, 
don't you feel the passion ready to explode, 
what goes on between us no one has to know, 
this is a private show (oh)

Bridge

Chorus 

Please don't stop the music (3x)
