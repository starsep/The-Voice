I'm in the
for in place
with the nerd
lock away
there's no where
in this space
everything that i've known
has been erase

is it a fiction of
my imagination
or could i be losing my mind
this illusion has got me in a situation im feeling like im trap in time
in time

this just cant be love
feels like the strangers
tearing me apart
torching my heart

this just cant be love
what happen to us
there is no more trust
this don't feel like love
im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy

he's asleep
im a wake
his heartbeats
my heart breaks
the same hands
the same face
some how love disappear with no trace

is it a fiction of
my imagination
or could i be living a lie
this illusion has got me in a situation im feeling like im trap in time
time

(2x)this just cant be love
feels like the strangers
tearing me apart
torching my heart

this just cant be love
what happen to us
there is no more trust
this don't feel like love
im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
