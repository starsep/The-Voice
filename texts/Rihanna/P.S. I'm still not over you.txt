[Verse 1] 
Whassup? i know we haven't spoken for a while 
I was thinking bout you and it kinda made me smile 
So many things to say and I'll put them in a letter 
Thought it might be easier, the words might come out better 
How's your mother? How's your little brother? Does he still look just like you? 
So many things I wanna know the answers to 
Wish i could press rewind and rewrite every line to the story of me and you 
[chorus] 
Don't you know I've tried, I've tried to get you off my mind 
but it don't get no better as each day go by 
and I'm lost and confuse I've got nothing to lose 
hope to hear from you soon... P.S I'm still not over you 
[verse 2] 
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on 
there's a lot of feelings that remains since you?ve been gone 
I guess you thought that I would've it all behind me 
but it seems there's always something right there to remind me 
like a silly joke or something on the TV, boy it ain't easy 
when I hear our song I get that same old feeling 
wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time and I shouldn't be telling you 
[chorus] 
Don't you know I've tried, I've tried to get you off my mind 
but it don't get no better as each day go by 
and I'm lost and confuse I've got nothing to lose 
hope to hear from you soon... P.S I'm still not over you 
(you, still not over you) 
[verse 3] 
Did you know I've kept all of your pictures 
Don't have the strength to part with them yet 
Oooh nooo.. tried to erase 
The way your kisses taste 
But some things a girl can never forget 
[chorus] 
Don't you know I've tried, I've tried to get you off my mind 
but it don't get no better as each day go by 
and I'm lost and confuse I've got nothing to lose 
hope to hear from you soon... P.S I'm still not over you 
Still not over you, see I've tried to forget you 
Don't you know I've tried, I've tried to get you off my mind 
but it don't get no better as each day go by 
and I'm lost and confuse I've got nothing to lose 
hope to hear from you soon... P.S I'm still not over you
