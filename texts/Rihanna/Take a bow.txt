How about a round of applause
A standing ovation

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You’re so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

_[Chorus]_
Don’t tell me you’re sorry cuz you’re not
Baby when I know you’re only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
You really had me going
But now it’s time to go
Curtain’s finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it’s over now
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone
You better hurry up before the sprinklers come on
Talkin’ about, girl, I love you, you’re the one
This just looks like the re-run
Please, what else is on

_[Chorus]_

And don’t tell me you’re sorry cuz you’re not
Baby when I know you’re only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
You really had me going
But now it’s time to go
Curtain’s finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it’s over now
Go on and take a bow

And the award for the best liar goes to you
For making me believe that you could be
Faithful to me
lets here your speech ohh

How about a round of applause
A standing ovation

_[Chorus]_
But you put on quite a show
You really had me going
Now it’s time to go
Curtain’s finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it’s over now
Go on and take a bow

But it's over now
