It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over

I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if ya feelin' brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it
Stadium gonna do the wave
I'm such a fuckiin' lady
You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble don't ya fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait
But together we gon' be takin' over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

So you don't wanna wait
I hate to hear, that's such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways
Ain't no timeout in my game
They already underway
I know you wanna win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble don't ya fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait
But together we gon' be takin' over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

Babe, you put the work in like the champion
Look the crowd is screamin'
With their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else
You're the only way I'll win
Babe, ya got the whole world standing up
Damn, I'm glad picked ya
Took a chance on love
Babe you're up
The time is now
And now the wait is over

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
(Just wait your turn)
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
(Just wait your turn)

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble don't ya fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait
But together we gon' be takin' over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
