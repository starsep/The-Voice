I must dream
That's not real
You love me
For the eternity
I never felt this so strong
When we are alone
'Cause that was so long
To know what you've done


Crazy destiny
Crazy eternity
I'm alone
It's not catastrophic
This horrible sound
Can hurt your ear


I should leave
Far away like a dead
I'm stupid
But it's the destiny
I can take it on my own
Without you won't know
What I could hold at long
In my life in this song


Crazy destiny
Crazy eternity
I'm alone
It's not catastrophic
This horrible sound
Can hurt your ear

I must dream
That's not real
You love me
For the eternity
Baby come in
Need me
I can't fight
All alone with the night


Crazy destiny (crazy destiny)
Crazy eternity (sorry baby)
I'm alone (don' t care)
It's not catastrophic (please share)
This horrible sound
Can hurt your ear
I don't want hurt you deep your heart
Yeah yeah yeah...
