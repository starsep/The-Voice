Kisses dont 
No they dont 
Never dont lie 
You can run if you want but you cant hide 
Tellin you its the truth dont you ask why 
Kisses dont 
No they dont 
Kisses dont lie 

[ Verse 1: ] 
Emotions come and go 
Almost how the wind will blow 
There so little in this world to trust in 
Seduce themselves with lies 
Some dont realize 
They call it love but its really only lustin 

[ Refrain: ] 
So you see you and me 
We're gettin close to the danger zone 
Show me how tell me now 
Should I stay or should i go 
Cause I'm caught between yes and no 

[ Hook: ] 
Cause when you kiss me 
I feel everything that I been missing 
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen 
And its tearin me all up inside 
And when you touch me 
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me 
Should I put my trust in somethin I dont trust in 
I try to run but theres no place to hide 
Cause baby kisses dont lie 

Kisses dont 
No they dont 
Never dont lie 
You can run if you want but you cant hide 
Tellin you its the truth dont you ask why 
Kisses dont 
No they dont 
Kisses dont lie 

[ Verse 2: ] 
You whisper in my ear 
But are your words sincere 
Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife 
You see I'm nobody's fool 
I play by my own rules 
So please think twice before you step into my life 

[ Refrain: ] 
So you see you and me 
We're gettin close to the danger zone 
Show me how tell me now 
Should I stay or should i go 
Cause I'm caught between yes and no
