Baby slow down 
Just hear me out 
Something I've gotta let you know 
There's no need to push 
No need to rush 
You know you had me from hello 

When it comes to my heart I don't play 
Baby boy can't you see the stop sign 
Were movin' much to fast 
Baby luck doesn't grow in a day 
Let's get it right the first time and make this feelin' last 

Baby if your willing to wait 
We can just take our time (take our time) 
Don't you know that it's getting late 
And I know whats on your mind (on your mind) 
I know this feeling is crazy 
It's mutual baby 
But we don't have to rush something real 
Baby if your willing to wait 
We can just take our time (take our time) 

Boy can't you see 
Am not tryin' to be 
A girl that gets takin' for a ride 
If you take you time 
Then you will find 
There's so much more to me inside 

You say there's no need to delay 
Your telling me to trust you 
Boy you know I want to baby 
But my hearts can so easily break 
Before we take this very far 
Show me who you really are 

Baby if your willing to wait 
We can just take our time (take our time) 
Don't you know that it's getting late 
And I know whats on your mind (on your mind) 
I know this feeling is crazy 
It's mutual baby 
But we don't have to rush something real 
Baby if your willing to wait 
We can just take our time (take our time) 

Hey baby 
Baby luck doesn't grow in a day 
Let's get right the first time and make this feelin' last 

Baby if your willing to wait 
We can just take our time (take our time) 
Don't you know that it's getting late 
And I know whats on your mind (on your mind) 
I know this feeling is crazy 
It's mutual baby 
But we don't have to rush something real 
Baby if your willing to wait 
We can just take our time (take our time)
