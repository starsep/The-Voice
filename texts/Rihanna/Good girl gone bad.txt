We stay moving around so low 
Ask us where you went 
We don’t know and don’t care (don’t care) 
All we know is we was at home cuz you left us there 
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone 
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on 
Cats goin at her, keep that dress on 
Tryna get enough drinks in her system 
Take her to the telly and make her a victim 

Patrol in the brink 
Bar bangin with the bass 
They shake the spot 
She’s just another cake 

Easy for a good girl to go bad 
And once we gone 
Best believe we gone forever 
Don’t be the reason 
Don’t be the reason 
You better learn how to treat us right 
Cuz once a good girl goes bad 
We gone forever 

He steady with the flock of em o ya 
Got a girl left home but he don’t care 
Won’t care, all you is keep me at home 
Won’t let me go no where 
If it’s because I’m at home 
I won’t be gettin’ it on 
And now im finding numbers 
In the jacket pockets 
Chicks call in the house 

Non-stop 
It’s getting out of control 
Finally I can’t take no more 
He finds a letter on the stairs 
Saying this is the end 
I packed my bag and left with your best friend 

Easy for a good girl to go bad 
And once we gone 
Best believe we gone forever 
Don’t be the reason 
Don’t be the reason 
You better learn how to treat us right 
Cuz once a good girl goes bad 
We gone forever 

We stay moving around so low
