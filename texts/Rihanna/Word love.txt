Just when I thought I'd never fall in love again
You'd knock me off my feet
Make my heart drop a beat, I ain't never had,
Make me feel it's spring again and the last romance seemed like a fling
I ain't never had, never had
A love like this and understanding space and time
I'm so glad you're mine, glad you're mine

Sometimes the word love
Just ain't good enough
To describe this I feel for you
Sometimes the word love
Just ain't good enough
To describe this I feel for you

Just when I thought I'd never get that chance again
You swept me from my feet
And kissed me oh so sweet, like I never had,
Like the way you treat me like a lady
Even when I'm acting crazy, sure it's love enough, love enough
Thank you for understanding, space and time
I'm so glad you're mine, glad you're mine

Chorus

Just ain't good enough
Chorus (Repeat 2 Fade)
