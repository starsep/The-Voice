Yeah, I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah, you know word of mouth
The square root of 69 is 8 something, right?
'Cause I've been trying to work it out
Ohhhh good weed, white wine
Uh, I come alive in the night time
OK away we go
The only thing we have on is the radio
Let it play
Say you gotta leave, but I know you want to stay
You just waiting on the traffic jam to finish girl
The things that we can do with 20 minutes girl
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's getting hot, crack a window - air it out
I can get you thru a mighty long day
Soon as you go the text I write is gonna say

[Rihanna]
Not everybody knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it, boy you stay up on it
You got that something that keeps me so off balance
