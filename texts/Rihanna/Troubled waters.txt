You you you you

I was such a fool for you
Would do anything you asked trough
Only had eyes for you
You grabbed your other fellas in your cruel
Ey

I miss fucked your games
The things you did
They drove me insane
The way we used to make love
The lights were off
I can't all the stop
Sleeping alone
And feeling rush

And I'm a fool
For feeling like I really want him back, I want him back
Tell me I'm a ruin
When the love I had
It never last, it never last
I need a bridge
To get me over the troubled water
I need a bridge
To get me over you

Tell me how would I make this transition?
Can't kick it to the other side
Reminiscences
Think it is well
It's worth risk a diving
Maybe I would drown, maybe thrown, by the under advise me
It keeps me alive

When I'm going up and deep
No bets, but I got life stress
When it all falls down
I will put it to a task

And I'm a fool
For feeling like I really want him back, I want him back
Tell me I'm a ruin
When the love I had
It never last, it never last
I need a bridge
To get me over the troubled water
I need a bridge
To get me over you

With this meaning ups and downs
Guess I thought to make you work
And now I knew the girls will come alone
Now she is enjoying all my purse
And I still have my pride
Guess I think it's too deep inside
And too ashamed to come find
That I'm still in love with you

And I'm a fool
For feeling like I really want him back, I want him back
Tell me I'm a ruin
When the love I had
It never last, it never last
I need a bridge
To get me over the troubled water
I need a bridge
To get me over you
