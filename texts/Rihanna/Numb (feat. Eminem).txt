[Verse 1: Rihanna]

Ecstasy in the air
I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired
The worst to wear
Cause.. 

[Hook: Rihanna]

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne smash, Let the man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne smash, Let the man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb...

[Verse 2: Rihanna]

Can't you say
Catch yourself in the clear
I don't care
Get closer to me
If you dare
I double dare

[Hook: Rihanna]

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne smash, Let the man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne smash, Let the man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb...


[Verse 3: Eminem]

I'm classy, high walk
Look me in my eyeball
Do I look high, no
I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear
Trying to get closer to you
I'm motioning you to pull over boo
I'm the siren that you hear
I'm the butt police, and I'm looking at your rear, rear, rear
But aight, dawg, I'mma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the Oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
Cause I'm sick of sniffing asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
And suspenders, and I can't feel my lips cause

[Hook: Rihanna]
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne smash, Let the man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne smash, Let the man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb...
