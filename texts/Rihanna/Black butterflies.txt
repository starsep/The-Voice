Baby
Butterflies they gave me such a feeling
Everytime I saw your face
They started flying
Now my heart is in the shadow
Of the creatures they turned into
And I wish
That I could make them fly away

I can tell this is my style
There's a war on the inside
I can tell this is my style
And I gotta stand up and fly

How do I kill these butterflies
Terrorizing me inside
How do I stop the battle cries
Screaming out through the night
Doesn't matter what you say
I'm still gonna feel this way
These black black butterflies
Taking over me

Black black butterflies
Black black butterflies
Black black butterflies
Black black butterflies

I can see them moving deep inside of me
And my body's beggin me to set 'em free
I'm in desperate need of healing
'Cause the damage in my whole being
Is there any away to make em fly away

I can tell this is my style
There's a war on the inside
I can tell this is my style
And I gotta stand up and fly

How do I kill these butterflies
Terrorizing me inside
How do I stop the battle cries
Screaming out through the night
Doesn't matter what you say
I'm still gonna feel this way
These black black butterflies
Taking over me

Black black butterflies
Black black butterflies
Taking over me
Black black butterflies
Black black butterflies

Black, black, black, black butterflies
Rihanna, go on it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come and set me free
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get out of my face,
Get out of my face, right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Set, set me free
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Doesn't matter what you say
I'm still gonna feel this way

How do I kill these butterflies
Terrorizing me inside
How do I stop the battle cries
Screaming out through the night
Doens't matter what you say
I'm still gonna feel this way
These black black butterflies
Taking over me

Black black butterflies
