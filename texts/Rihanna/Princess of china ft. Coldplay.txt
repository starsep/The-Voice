Ohhhhh...

Once upon a time somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I've got to go... I've got to go
Once upon a time we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh!

Ohhhhh...

Once upon a time, we burned bright
And all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on... and on, and on, and on...
Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side in the same game
And why'd you have to go, have to go and throw it all on my fate

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and wore a ring
But no, you let me go!
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and wore a ring
But no, you let me go!

You stole my star
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You stole my star la, la la la la laaaaaa

Oooooooh-oh oh oooooooh oh oh oh ohhhhhhhhh
Oooooooh-oh oh oooooooh oh oh oh ohhhhhhhhh

'Cause you really hurt me
No you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
No you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Ooooooooh no you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Ooooooooh no you really hurt me...
