Gimme shoes and give me bags, how much you want I need 'em bad,

All them girls be checking my bags, buy it they be wanting my swag,
I guess you know I'm B--aaa-aaa-aaad, (B-aaa-aaa-aaad),

What a bad little girl I am, (I got a problem)
What a bad little girl I am, (I need you to promise)
What a bad little girl I am, (bad bad bad bad bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am, (I got a problem)
What a bad little girl I am (I need you to promise)
What a bad little girl I am, (bad bad bad bad bad bad)

All them girls be checking my bags, buy it they be wanting my swag
I guess you know I'm B--aaa-aaa-aaad, (B-aaa-aaa-aaad),

What a bad little girl I am, (I got a problem)

She a bad girl, a real shopaholic,
She buying everything up man I can't call it,
And she a walking store, I'm talking bout her clothes,
I just pause I'm in awe she's a fashion show,
Free louis bags and free gucci,
Got a wardrobe like she's staring in a movie,
And she ain't even famous but she got her own groupies,
She got her own groupies,
She got her own groupies,

What a bad little girl I am, (I got a problem)
What a bad little girl I am, (I need you to promise)
What a bad little girl I am, (bad bad bad bad bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am, (I got a problem)
What a bad little girl I am (I need you to promise)
What a bad little girl I am, (bad bad bad bad bad bad)
