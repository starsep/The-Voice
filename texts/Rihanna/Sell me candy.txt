Sell me candy like the summer 
When it's melting in my hand
I know you're around 
Like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling whisper something in my ear
Sweet like sugar tell me what I wanna hear
I'm weak by your touch 
And when it's meltin on my lips
A rush through my body 
Feel it in my fingertips
You selling me your 
Fantasy that I wanna explore
Sound so good 
Spoil me rotten to the core

{Pre-Chorus}
Talk to me 
Take care of my dreams
All I need 
Is you beside me
It's destiny 
Just let it be 
Of the words you speak
Baby sell it to me

{Chorus}
Sell me candy
Sell me love
Sell me heaven
Sell me doves
What's the charge
What's the cost 
[Come to daddy]
You the boss

Be a professional 
Boy you make a sale
I try to resist 
But every time I fail

The one temptation that I gotta enjoy
You're running through my garden now you're knocking at my door
Forbidden little kiss
And you call it bittersweet
The shorty that you rocking with 
Ain't nothin' like me
You selling me your fantasy that I wanna explore
Sound so good spoil me rotten to the core
You know

{Pre-Chorus}

{Chorus}

I want it babe
More than you know
So don't you leave 
And dont you go
I want it all 
Until time falls
These arms 
Won't hold you wrong
I want your love 
Give you my trust
I wanna live 
For both of us
I wanna breath ya 
Lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm ya 
When nights colder

I want love, love
L-o-ve
I want love, love, love

{Pre-Chorus}

{Chorus}
