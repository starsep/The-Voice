Feel the adrenaline 
moving under my skin
It's an addiction
such an eruption
Sound is my remedy 
feeding me energy
Music is all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care,care,care
(feel it in the air yeah)

[Chorus]
She's been a crazy dita,
disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?
Too cold for you
to keep her
Too hot for you
to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick? x3

[Verse 2]
Back on the dancefloor 
better not to take me home
Bass kicking so hot 
blazing through my beating heart
French kissin on the floor, 
heart is beating hardcore
Everybody is getting a little sexy 
on the crazy juice
This will end up on the news

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care,care,care
(feel it in the air yeah)

[Chorus]
She's been a crazy dita,
disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?
Too cold for you
to keep her
Too hot for you
to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick? x3

[Bridge]
I'll try to sex you up the night 
has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up 
oh yeah
My heart is a dancer 
beating like a disco drum
Oh,oh,oh,oohh,wooh,oh,oh

I'll try to sex you up the night 
has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up 
oh yeah
My heart is a dancer 
beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum x3


[Chorus]
She's been a crazy dita,
disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?
Too cold for you
to keep her
Too hot for you
to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick? x3
