Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out

Strip clubs and dollar bills
I still got more money
Patron shots can I get a refill?
I still got more money
Strippers goin' up and down that pole
And I still got more money
Four o'clock and we ain't going home
Cause I still got more money
Money make the world go round
I still got more money
Bands make your girl go down
I still got more money
Find more where that came from
I still got more money
The look in yo eyes I know you want some
I still got more money

Ohhhh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ohhhh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind

Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out

Valet cost a hundred bill
I still got more money
Gold all up in my grill
I still got more money
Who cares how you haters feel
And I still got more money
Call Jay up and close a deal
I still got more money
My fragrance on and they love my smell
I still got more money
So who cares about what I spend
I still got more money
My pocket's deep, and they never end
I still got more money
I'm going dumb with all my friends
I still got more money

Ohhhh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ohhhh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind

Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
