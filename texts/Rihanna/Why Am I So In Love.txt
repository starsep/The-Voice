[Chris Brown]
You know what I'm thinkin'
You know that it's you,
But some things need perfection,
Unlike you,

[Rihanna &amp; Chris Brown]
So why am I so in love?
Your the best thing in my life and always will be

[Rihanna]
I'm so glad your mine,
You mean the world to me,

[Chris Brown]
Your like a summers day,

[Rihanna &amp; Chris Brown]
I asked for your love,
You gave it to me,
I needed your trust,
The same as can be,

[Rihanna]
I thought I would lose you,
But I knew I was wrong,

[Chris Brown]
So why did it have to happen,
When you sing this song,

[Rihanna &amp; Chris Brown]
I know my mistakes,
So light as a dove,
I learn from them all,
Why am I so in love,

[Rihanna]
'Coz I need to know,
What's in my heart,

[Chris Brown]
Like a love,
In my love chart,

*CHORUS*
[Rihanna &amp; Chris Brown]
I asked for your love,
You gave it to me,
I needed your trust,
The same as can be,
Repeat chorus

[Rihanna &amp; Chris Brown]
My love is strong,
Why am I so in love?
