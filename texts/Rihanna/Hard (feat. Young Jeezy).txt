Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah 

They can say whatever
I'ma do whatever
No pain is forever 
Yup, you know this
Tougher than a lion
Ain't no need in tryin'
I live where the sky ends 
Yup, you know this

Never lyin'
Truth teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All black on
Black top shades
Black top Maybach
I'ma rock this shit
Like fashion
As in goin' till they say stop
And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear
And while you're getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly on
Sincere
I see you aiming at my pedestal
I better let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard
Yeah, yeah, yeah (that Rihanna reign just won't let up)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (that Rihanna reign just won't let up)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (that Rihanna reign just won't let up)
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

All up on it
Know you wanna clone it
Ain't like me (that chick to flaunt it)
Ride this beat, beat, beat (like a pony)
Meet me at the top (top) top
(Getting loaded)
Who think they test me now?
Run through your town I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got
I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that (all on me like that), yeah
I see you aiming on my pedestal
So I think I gotta let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

[Young Jeezy]
Go hard or go home 
Back to your residence 
Soon the red doors get a block back to the presidents 
I used to run my old block like Obama did 
You don't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then 
Couldn't even come in my room 
Smell like a kilo 
Look like me and two of my boys playin' casino 
Cali's all I keep in my bag in California 
Tell them to give me back my swag 
They try to clone me 
You see my Louis chucks, Louis bag, Louis frames, Louis belt 
What that make me Louis mane 
I'm in the all white party wearin' all black 
With my new black watch called the heart attack 
Cardiac arrest, cardiac wrist 
Yeah, they say they're hard 
They ain't hard as this 
Hard! 
One word describes me 
And if I wasn't doin' this 
You know where I be, too hard 

Where them girls talkin' trash?
Where them girls talkin' trash?
Where they at?
Where they at?
Where they at?
Where them bloggers at?
Where them bloggers at?
Where they at?
Where they at?
Where they at?
Where your lighters at?
Where your lighters at?
Where they at?
Where they at?

So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard
That I, I, I...
