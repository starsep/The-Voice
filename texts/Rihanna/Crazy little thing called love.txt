When you stand so close to me 
I'm feeling butterflies is this 
The way that its supposed to be 
When I look into your eyes 
All you have to do is say my name 
I st-stutta melt like butta 
Since I met you boy 
My whole worlds changed 
I cant hide this or deny this

Boy you got me catchin feelins 
Got me thinkin maybe your the one 
I didn't understand the reason 
That my heart was beatin like a drum 
I didn't understand the meanin 
Then you opened up my eyes 
To a crazy little thing called love 
Crazy little thing called love 
Crazy little thing called love

My best friend's tellin me Rihanna 
Whats got into you 
I said Aleandra i cant explain 
These feelings I'm goin through 
They tell me girl its not like you 
To fall this way 
I try my best to wear a disguise 
But its written on my face

Boy you got me catchin feelins 
Got me thinkin maybe your the one 
I didn't understand the reason 
That my heart was beatin like a drum 
I didn't understand the meanin 
Then you opened up my eyes 
To a crazy little thing called love 
Crazy little thing called love 
Crazy little thing called love

Its not crazy its amazing 
Its the lovin that your feelin 
Put a tinglin in your body 
Every time you wanna heal it 
Hey Rihanna baby girl for you 
Ma sing a songa so tell the DJ 
Put it pon de replay if you wanna 
Come on my Bajan baby 
Let me take you to Jamaica 
Introduce you to the real 
Type of lovin that you outta 
Baby your my number one my number two 
So if its lovin that you want
Baby you should make me your boo

Boy you got me catchin feelins 
Got me thinkin maybe your the one 
I didn't understand the reason 
That my heart was beatin like a drum 
I didn't understand the meanin 
Then you opened up my eyes 
To a crazy little thing called love 
Crazy little thing called love 
Crazy little thing called love

Don't understand the meanin 
This feelins crazy baby 
Try my best not to show 
But you know its so crazy baby 

Crazy little thing called love 
Crazy little thing called love
