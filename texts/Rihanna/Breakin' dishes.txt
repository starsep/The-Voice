[x4]
I don't know who you think I am

He been gone since 3.30 (3.30)
Been comin home lately at 3.30 (3.30)
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot and baby you won't get it
Now I ain't trippin', I, I aint twistin
I am demented, I'm just a little bit (huh)
I'm kickin ass, I'm taking names
I'm on a flame, don't come home babe

[CHORUS]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here
All night (uh huh)
I ain't gonna stop until I see police lights (uh huh)
I'm a fight a man (tonight)
I'm a fight a man (tonight)
I'm a fight a man
A man, on a m-a-a-a-aan
A man, a man, on a m-a-a-a-aan
Oh

I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time and I'm bleachin ya clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burnin, is your attire
I'm gettin restless, I'm gettin tested
And I cant believe hes always out every night and never checks in
Must be cheatin, man i dont know
Im looking round for somethin else to throw

[CHORUS]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here
All night (uh huh)
I ain't gonna stop until I see police lights (uh huh)
I'm a fight a man (tonight)
I'm a fight a man (tonight)
I'm a fight a man
A man, on a m-a-a-a-aan
A man, a man, on a m-a-a-a-aan
Oh

(Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh)
I don't know who you think I am
(I dont know who you think I am)
But I really don't give a damn right now
(Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh)
If you don't come I'm a huff and puff and
Blow this, Blow this, huh
Blow this, Blow this, 
I'm a blow this, blow this, huh
Blow this, Blow this 
I'm a blow this, blow this, huh
Blow this house down
Dishes, breakin' dishes, breakin' dishes

[CHORUS]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here
All night (uh huh)
I ain't gonna stop until I see police lights (uh huh)
I'm a fight a man (tonight)
I'm a fight a man (tonight)
I'm a fight a man
A man, on a m-a-a-a-aan
A man, a man, on a m-a-a-a-aan

On a man, on a man, on a m-a-a-a-aan 
On a man, on a man, on a m-a-a-a-aan 

Breakin' dishes
