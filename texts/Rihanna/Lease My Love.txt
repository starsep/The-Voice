you can’t lease my love x9
oh, this was just an empty space
that both we tried to live
with windows and a can of paint
and we began to build

in spite of that
(try to build it up x3)
in spite of this
(try to build it up x3)

i have felt such an imbalance
loved my way around it
and everyone around believed
that one of us was in it for the profit
(for the profit, for the profit)
just for the profit

now we’re months behind the rent
every dollar gone unspent
getting closer to the end
it all depends

if you would break from me
break from me
break away from me
you tried to lease my love
lease my love, lease my love
but you can’t cheat my love
go on and lease my love

lease my love, lease my love
you can’t cheat my love
i knew this day will come,
it came so very quick
i knew that once we fell apart
no rule will ever stick
and we would fold the profit
(fold the profit x5)

now we’re months behind the rent
every dollar gone unspent
getting closer to the end
it all depends

if you would break from me
