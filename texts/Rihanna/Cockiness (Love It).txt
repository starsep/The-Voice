Suck my cockiness 
Lick my persuasion 
Eat my words and then 
Swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs 
Over your resistance 
And then you come around 
You come around 
You come around

I want you to be my sex slave 
Anything that I desire 
Be one with my femin-ay 
Set my whole body on fire
They mad at Rihanna game 
Taking over your empire 
She may be the queen of hearts 
But I'ma be the queen of your body parts

No one can do you the way that I do 
Boy I want (you) 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it when you eat it

Suck my cockiness 
Lick my persuasion 
Eat my words and then
Swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs 
Over your resistance 
And then you come around 
You come around 
You come around

I can be your dominatrix 
Just submit to my every order 
Enter my diamond matrix 
If you want my golden flower
Make me your priority 
There's nothing above my pleasure 
She may be the queen of hearts 
But I'ma be the queen of your body parts

No one can do you the way that I do 
Boy I want (you) 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it when you eat it

Homie don't beat it like a bullet 
Beat my drum drum like a drum line boogie 
(I love it when you) 
Dive head first if you wanna 
Sing to my body, hold me tight mister lover 
(I love it when you) 
Do it like I do it like I said 
Keep it up, boy we can do this all day 
Be my Harlem and me St. Tropez 
Never found nobody that will do it this way

No one can do ya 
No one can do you the way that I do 
Boy I want (you) 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it, I love it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it when you eat it 
I love it when you eat it
