The steps on the stairs,
Aren\'t really there,
Feel like there\'s someone watchin\' me,
Shadows on the wall,
Whispers down the hall,
When I look there\'s nothin\' to see,
You say that you let her go,
Turn the page and closed the door,
I can\'t get inside your head,
\'Cause when I try she\'s there instead.

[Chorus]
Can\'t compete with a memory,
How can I fight with someone that I can\'t see?
There\'s two of us but it feels like three,
I wish her ghost would just let us be,
Boy you\'re everythin\' I ever wanted,
But I got to let you go \'cause this love is,
Haunted,
Haunted.

[Verse 2]
You say that she\'s gone,
That you\'ve moved on,
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain,
Won\'t you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me,
Your eyes see someone I can\'t see,
So I\'ve given up this war,
Cause\' I can\'t fight it anymo-ore.

[Chorus]
Can\'t compete with a memory,

How can I fight with someone that I can\'t see?
There\'s two of us but it feels like three,
I wish her ghost would just let us be,
Boy you\'re everythin\' I ever wanted,
But I got to let you go \'cause this love is,
Haunted,
Haunted.

[Bridge]
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave, ohh noo,
The walls are close and then it\'s so damn hard to breath.

[Spoken Whisper]
And ain\'t nothin\' I could do about it.

[Chorus]
Can\'t compete with a memory,
How can I fight with someone that I can\'t see?
There\'s two of us but it feels like three,
I wish her ghost would just let us be,
Boy you\'re everythin\' I ever wanted,
But I got to let you go \'cause this love is,
Haunted (haunted),
Haunted.

Haunted,
Haunted.

I don\'t want to fight anymore,
Someone\'s walkin\' out that door.

Haunted,
Haunted.
Haunted.
