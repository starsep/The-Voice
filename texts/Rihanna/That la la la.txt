You say the girls, they love you wild 
You look at my man with a funny smile 
Now I don't know, it might be me 
But ain't no need to hug so tightly 
That night we're all hangin at the club 
You tell mister DJ wanna rubadub 
I kinda looked, you took the chance 
To ask my man to come and dance 
What me and he got 
Is solid as a rock so take your shot 
Don't even waste your time 
Cuz a love like ours is hard to find 

Cuz he got me singin that la la la 
Our love is raw yes it's giving me butterflies 
Oh yes he keep it rockin like la la la 
Say (whoa) ladies get it right (whoa) better get it right 
He got me singin that la la la 
So go back, don't be hatin you can't deny 
Oh yes he keep it rockin like la la la 
Say (whoa) ladies get it right (whoa) better get it right 

I hope you take this as a lesson learned 
This ain't that kind of party so just let it burn 
The next time you see me act like you know 
I don't play those games, don't take me for a dope 
What me and he got 
Is solid as a rock so take your shot 
Don't even waste your time 
Cuz a love like ours is hard to find 

Cuz he got me singin that la la la 
Our love is raw yes it's giving me butterflies 
Oh yes he keep it rockin like la la la 
Say (whoa) ladies get it right (whoa) better get it right 
He got me singin that la la la 
So go back, don't be hatin you can't deny 
Oh yes he keep it rockin like la la la 
Say (whoa) ladies get it right (whoa) better get it right 

He, he got it 
He's the only one I need 
He got that la la la 

He got me singin' that la la la 
Our love is raw yes it's giving me butterflies 
Oh yes he keep it rockin like la la la 
Say (whoa) ladies get it right (whoa) better get it right 

He got me singin that la la la 
So go back, don't be hatin you can't deny 
Oh yes he keep me rockin like la la la 
Say (whoa) ladies get it right (whoa) better get it right
