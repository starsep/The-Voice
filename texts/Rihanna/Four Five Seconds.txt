[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I think I've had enough, I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind, I might do a little time
Cause all of my kindness, is taken for weakness

[Hook: Rihanna]
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh thats all I want

[Kanye West]
Woke up an optimist, sun is shining I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back I'm bout' to spaz

[Hook]
Yeah, I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh thats all I want

[Bridge]
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' how could I be so selfish
But you called bout a thousand times wondering where I been
Now I know that your up tonight
Thinkin' how could I be so reckless
But I just can't apologize, I hope you can understand

[Kanye West]
If I go to jail tonight, promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride, but that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness, is taken for weakness

[Hook]
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh thats all I want

FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
That's all I want
