First Time You Kissed My Lips
The First Time Your Finger Tips
Touchin' Me Couldn't Resist
The First, The The First

[Rihanna &amp; Fabolous ]
Wooh ..I Think Everybody Remember The First Time
I Do, Its Irresistable, Its Unstoppable
Guess Who, First Time Fab
Sound Like You Hear Me For The First Time Again Baby[haha]

First Time You Kissed My Lips
The First Time Your Finger Tips
Touchin' Me Couldn't Resist
I Knew I Was Meant For This

[Fabolous Verse 1]
My First Time Checkin You, Only Took A Second To
Start Inspectin You, Without Disrespectin You
Wasn't Inspectin You, To Say It Was Affectin You
What You Wearin Got Me Starin Like You Butt Naked Boo
It May Seem, Like I Dont Even Reckon You
But I Day Dream, About Kissin On The Neck Of You
Style Is Impeccable, Smile Is Incredible
Ain't Nothin' Like Ya, And Baby I Done Met A Few You
The Way I Feel Its Almost Like Crush[crushh]
My Heart Beats Faster Its Almost Like A Rush[rushh]
And Thats Just When You In a In a Room
I Could tell When You Round By The Scent Of Ya Perfume
I See Why They Put These R&amp;B Songs Together
I Feel Like Mariah "We Belong Together"
Its My Pleasure, I Treasure, That I Met Ya
I Could Get Ya On The First Time
