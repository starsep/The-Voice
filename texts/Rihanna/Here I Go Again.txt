Na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
Na na na na na oh na na na na na na na na 

[Verse 1] 

It's been a minute since I saw you boy 
Like some medicine to hear your voice 
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when your around 
See you haven't lost your sexy smile 
And you still could melt me with your smile 
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside 

[hook] 

It's funny how things could change 
But still remain the same 
Isn't life just a crazy game 
Baby here I go again 

[chorus] 

I look into your eyes and then 
My heart remembers when 
And I realize I neva gotten over you 
Everytime I hear your name 
It's like the sun shined through the rain 
And I realize this happenin' 
Baby here I go again 

Here I Go Again 

[Verse 2] 

Still remember how you make me weak 
How so hard to find the words to speak 
I just cant excape the memories 
I tried but I just cant break free 
But I closed the door on what we had 
But these feelings just keep comin back 
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that 

[Hook] 

[Chorus] 

[Hook] 

[Chorus]
