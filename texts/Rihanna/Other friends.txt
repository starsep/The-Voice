All the boys in tha house won't you come to my party 
cause there ain't no woman who can't get you started ( started ) 

[refrain]: 
From all the girls you'd ever met 
you're the first one 
with no other friends 
other friends 
other friends 
so don't stop play'in 
or you will be pay'in 

Now put you're hands in the air 
so i can see them all about 
girls we'll get this party started 
if only the boys could be here now 
so come and take a bow 
cause you ain't seen notting yet 

[refrain]: 
From all the girls you'd ever met 
you're the first one 
with no other friends 
other friends 
other friends 
so don't stop play'in 
or you will be pay'in ( x2 ) 

Keep ya head up 
keep ya head up 
cause we will be burnin up 
in this crowd
