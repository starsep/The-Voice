[Chorus]
Something bout the way that you workin' me
Teasin' me, pleasin' me, easily boy
Im addicted to you 
Got a have ya for all the things that you do (Aaah) 
Something bout this feeling, its crazy
Amazing that stays with me all night and day, 
Makes my temperature rise 
Boy your love has got me so hypnotized 

[Verse 1]
Im feeling something that I cant understand 
Its like i'm captured by the touch of your hand 
Its so vibe its your style 
It's the way the that u smile 
Get a little rush when I hear your name 
Its all magnetic with your hand next to me 
Holdin' me close happens so naturally 
We connect, its electric, this felling inside 
Didnt know that even if I tried 

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You got me spinning like a merry go round 
Feels like Im flyin' but I aint off the ground 
Fallin' fast Im a afraid cant escape theres no way 
Never had a feeling like this before

[Chorus]

Its amazing how you drive me crazy 
Boy keep doin what youre doin 
Cause youre really gettin through to me 
Day and night babe you know I cant fight it 
Just one look into my eyes and you know you got me hypnotized 

[Chorus]
