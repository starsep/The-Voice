I'm alone and feelin` unrestrained (unrestrained)
Got no one to tell me what to do can't keep me contained
No restrictions can't drive me insane (me insane)
And I'm feeling like a bird and you just unlocked the cage

I'm flying so high could you be the type of guy who catches my eye keep on looking out on then
and now I feel free baby can't effect on me a change of the scene

I think I'm liking being single single single
I can be where I want when I want to single single single
and the talk works for you but I got to single single single
you can dance with me but you don't have to single single single
I think I'm liking being single

Baby no one's gonna hold me back I'll be acting like an animal about to attack
So amazing just to be realised I'll be turning up the volume keep on bumping the trees

I'm feeling alive I can't keep these thoughts inside
They're rapping my mind are you ready for this
You're letting me go I'm not property you know I'm skipping the clothes

I think I'm liking being single single single
I can be where I want when I want to single single single
and the talk works for you but I got to single single single
you can dance with me but you don't have to single single single
I think I'm liking being single single single (x2)

I think I'm liking being single (x2)

You can't hold me down I got a place of me I'm enjoying life
You set me free I got my rules on me anywhere I go

I think I'm liking be single single single
I can be where I want when I want to single single single
and the talk works for but i got to single single single
you can dance with me but you don't have to single single single
I think I'm liking being single single single (x2)
