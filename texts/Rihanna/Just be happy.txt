Verse 1
It's like spendin
Time with you just
Doing (Absolutley)
Nothing
That makes me happy

When you're
At work(Putting on your)
T-Shirt
And I love it
Absolutley love it

It's your smile of a child
It's your eyes its your hair
It's the touch of your skin
That's what gets me there

It's also enticing
Waking up from a nights dream
To a beautiful morning
with you by my side
That's nice

Through the sprinklers
Smelling
every flower one by one (yeah)
Makes me happy (yeah)

Showing me you love me baby

It's your smile of a child
It's your eyes its your hair
It's the touch of your skin
That's what gets me there

Waking up from a nights dream
To a beautiful morning
with you by my side
That's nice

Finding and seeking with you
Like we do
It's beautiful
