Sleep baby sleep,
The days on the run
The wind in the trees is talking in tones
Lullaby

If your heart is torn
I don't wonder why
If the night is gone
Is my lover there
Is my lover there

Well the mouse eats the crumb,
Then the cat eats the crumb.
Now they've fallen in love,
Then they're talking in tones

If your heart is torn
I don't wonder why
If the night is gone
Is my lover there
Is my lover there

Sleep baby sleep,
There's the morning to come,
The winds in the trees,
They're talking in tones
