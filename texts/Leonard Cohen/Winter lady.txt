Trav'ling lady, stay awhile 
until the night is over. 
I'm just a station on your way, 
I know I'm not your lover. 
Well I lived with a child of snow 
when I was a soldier, 
and I fought every man for her 
until the nights grew colder. 

She used to wear her hair like you 
except when she was sleeping, 
and then she'd weave it on a loom 
of smoke and gold and breathing. 

And why are you so quiet now 
standing there in the doorway? 
You chose your journey long before 
you came upon this highway. 

Trav'ling lady stay awhile 
until the night is over. 
I'm just a station on your way, 
I know I'm not your lover.
