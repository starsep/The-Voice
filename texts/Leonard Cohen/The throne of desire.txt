Their bodies Triumphant 
Their power unfurled 
I know I am nothing 
And women the world! 

A slave to their favours 
Their no and their yes 
I'm crushed in the crease 
Of a cotton dress 

And I'm dead except 
In their company 
And I'm only at rest 
When they motion to me 

And night after night 
I turn to myself 
And I raise them 
Out of my panic 
And they come to me 
Willing at last 
Inflamed and fast 
Mutual and graphic. 

And suddenly they drill my heart 
With cavities of absence 
And they cover their thighs 
with cellophane 
And they cover their breasts 
with a shadow 
And they nail my good right hand 
to a wall in the attic 

O take me away 
From the thorns and the fire 
And let me recline 
On the Throne of Desire 

From the Throne of Desire 
I make this solemn decree 
Every woman I want 
Will want, will want, will want 
Will more than want me!
