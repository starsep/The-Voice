I came upon a butcher, 
he was slaughtering a lamb, 
I accused him there 
with his tortured lamb. 
He said, "Listen to me, child, 
I am what I am 
and you, you are my only son." 
Well, I found a silver needle, 
I put it into my arm. 
It did some good, 
did some harm. 
But the nights were cold 
and it almost kept me warm, 
how come the night is long? 

I saw some flowers growing up 
where that lamb fell down; 
was I supposed to praise my Lord, 
make some kind of joyful sound? 
He said, "Listen, listen to me now, 
I go round and round 
and you, you are my only child." 

Do not leave me now, 
do not leave me now, 
I'm broken down 
from a recent fall. 
Blood upon my body 
and ice upon my soul, 
lead on, my son, it is your world.
