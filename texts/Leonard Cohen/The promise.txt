Once I was happy to 
Roam through the gold and blue 
Now something haunts me 
I know it's real 
Someone returns 
The desire I feel 

(Angels) We could have passed him by 

(Judy) Should have passed him by 
So many others cry 

(Angels) One more human cry 

(Judy) So many others 
Reaching for 
A thread through the night 
Or one lover more 

He has a dream 

(Angels) It's his dream 

(Judy) I dream it too 

(Angels) It's not your dream 

(Judy) He dreams of the promise 
We swore we would come through 

(Angels) The promise is not yours alone to honor 

(Judy) But we said we'd... 

(Angels) This is not our part 

(Judy) Open his heart 

(Angels) Now it is open 

(Judy) No, now it must start 

(Michael) You promised me whatever was in my heart 

(Angels) We promised him whatever was in his heart 

(Michael) You swore that I could speak from the heart 
(Angels) Yes, we said he'd speak from his heart 

(Michael) Now I have chosen 
And you must obey 

(Judy) I will obey 

(Michael) It's my heart that commands 
And it must have its way 
I want you 
I need you 
I can't live without you 
Anymore 

(Judy) Your heart commands me 
And I will obey you 
I need you 
I can't live without you 
Anymore 

(Judy &amp; Angels) We promised him whatever was 
in his heart 

(Michael) You promised me whatever was 
in my heart 

(Judy &amp; Angels) We said that he could speak 
from the heart 

(Michael) You swore that I could speak 
from the heart 

(Judy) And now he has chosen 
And now I must choose 
Tho' garlands of planets 
And starlight I lose 

(Angels) Now you must choose 
Starlight, starlight 
You're gonna lose him 

(Judy &amp; Michael) I want you, I need you 
I can't live without you 

(Everyone) I want you, I need you 
I can't live without you 
Anymore
