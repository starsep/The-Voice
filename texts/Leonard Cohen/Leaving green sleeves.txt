Alas, my love, you did me wrong, 
to cast me out discourteously, 
for I have loved you so long, 
delighting in your very company. 
Now if you intend to show me disdain, 
don't you know it all the more enraptures me, 
for even so I still remain your lover in captivity. 
Green sleeves, you're all alone, 
the leaves have fallen, the men have gone. 
Green sleeves, there's no one home, 
not even the Lady Green Sleeves 

I sang my songs, I told my lies, 
to lie between your matchless thighs. 
And ain't it fine, ain't it wild 
to finally end our exercise 
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn, 
oh, I hoped you would be someone new. 
I reached for you but you were gone, 
so lady I'm going too. 

Green sleeves, you're all alone ... 

Green sleeves, you're all alone, 
the leaves have fallen, the men have all gone home. 
Green sleeves, it's so easily done, 
leaving the Lady Green Sleeves.
