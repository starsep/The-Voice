(Michael) I burnt the house of love tonight 
It made a perfect ring 
In which I saw some weeds and stone 
Beyond not anything 

Certain creatures of the air 
Frightened by the night 
They came to see the world again 
And they perished in the light 

So now I sail from sky to sky 
And all the blackness sings 
Against the boat that I have made 
Of mutilated wings 

Fire in this house of mine 
Fire of my own design 
Fire from the sky 
Fire from the sea 
Come fire come 
Fire onto thee 
Fire in the house of love 

I burnt the house of love tonight 
I burnt the house of love tonight 
I burnt the house of love tonight
