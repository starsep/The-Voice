There was a child named Bernadette 
I heard the story long ago 
She saw the Queen of Heaven once 
And kept the vision in her soul 
No one believed what she had seen 
No one believed what she heard 
That there were sorrows to be healed 
And mercy, mercy in this world 

So many hearts I find 
Broke like yours and mine 
Torn by what we've done and can't undo 
I just want to hold you 
Won't you let me hold you 
Like Bernadette would do 

We've been, we fall, we fly 
We mostly fall, we moostly run 
And every now and then we try 
To mend the damage that we've done 
Tonight, tonight I cannot rest 
I've got this joy inside my breast 
To think that I did not forget 
That child, that song of Bernadette 

So many hearts I find ...
