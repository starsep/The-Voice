Many men have loved the bells 
you fastened to the rein, 
and everyone who wanted you 
they found what they will always want again. 
Your beauty lost to you yourself 
just as it was lost to them. 
Oh take this longing from my tongue, 
whatever useless things these hands have done. 
Let me see your beauty broken down 
like you would do for one you love. 

Your body like a searchlight 
my poverty revealed, 
I would like to try your charity 
until you cry, "Now you must try my greed." 
And everything depends upon 
how near you sleep to me 

Just take this longing from my tongue 
all the lonely things my hands have done. 
Let me see your beauty broken down 
like you would do for one your love. 

Hungry as an archway 
through which the troops have passed, 
I stand in ruins behind you, 
with your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps. 
I love to see you naked over there 
especially from the back. 

Oh take this longing from my tongue, 
all the useless things my hands have done, 
untie for me your hired blue gown, 
like you would do for one that you love. 

You're faithful to the better man, 
I'm afraid that he left. 
So let me judge your love affair 
in this very room where I have sentenced 
mine to death. 
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves 
that he's shaken from his head. 

Just take this longing from my tongue, 
all the useless things my hands have done, 
let me see your beauty broken down, 
like you would do for one you love. 

Like you would do for one you love.
