Oh but it's been such a long, long time. 
Thought I'd got you off my mind. 
Looks like I can't, just the thought of you 
turns my whole world a misty blue. 
Just the mention of your name 
fans the flicker to a flame. 
I can't forget the things we used to do. 
My whole world turns misty blue. 
You know I should forget you 
I really should, 
and heaven knows that I tried. 
But when I told you, 
when I said that we were through 
deep in my heart I lied 
Baby, oh what a long, long time. 
Thought I'd get you off my mind. 
Oh but I can't, just the thought of you 
turns my world misty blue 
And the very mention of your name 
fans the flicker to a flame. 
I think of things we used to do, 
my whole world turns misty blue.
