I finally broke into the prison, 
I found my place in the chain. 
Even damnation is poisoned with rainbows, 
all the brave young men 
they're waiting now to see a signal 
which some killer will be lighting for pay. 
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture, 
you whom I cannot betray. 

I fought in the old revolution 
on the side of the ghost and the King. 
Of course I was very young 
and I thought that we were winning; 
I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing 
as they carry the bodies away. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture... 

Lately you've started to stutter 
as though you had nothing to say. 
To all of my architects let me be traitor. 
Now let me say I myself gave the order 
to sleep and to search and to destroy. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture... 

Yes, you who are broken by power, 
you who are absent all day, 
you who are kings for the sake of your children's story, 
the hand of your beggar is burdened down with money, 
the hand of your lover is clay. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture...
