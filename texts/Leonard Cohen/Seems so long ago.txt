It seems so long ago, 
Nancy was alone, 
looking ate the Late Late show 
through a semi-precious stone. 
In the House of Honesty 
her father was on trial, 
in the House of Mystery 
there was no one at all, 
there was no one at all. 
It seems so long ago, 
none of us were strong; 
Nancy wore green stockings 
and she slept with everyone. 
She never said she'd wait for us 
although she was alone, 
I think she fell in love for us 
in nineteen sixty one, 
in nineteen sixty one. 

It seems so long ago, 
Nancy was alone, 
a forty five beside her head, 
an open telephone. 
We told her she was beautiful, 
we told her she was free 
but none of us would meet her in 
the House of Mystery, 
the House of Mystery. 

And now you look around you, 
see her everywhere, 
many use her body, 
many comb her hair. 
In the hollow of the night 
when you are cold and numb 
you hear her talking freely then, 
she's happy that you've come, 
she's happy that you've come.
