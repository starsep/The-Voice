I cannot follow you, my love, 
you cannot follow me. 
I am the distance you put between 
all of the moments that we will be. 
You know who I am, 
you've stared at the sun, 
well I am the one who loves 
changing from nothing to one. 

Sometimes I need you naked, 
sometimes I need you wild, 
I need you to carry my children in 
and I need you to kill a child. 

You know who I am... 

If you should ever track me down 
I will surrender there 
and I will leave with you one broken man 
whom I will teach you to repair. 

You know who I am... 

I cannot follow you, my love, 
you cannot follow me. 
I am the distance you put between 
all of the moments that we will be. 

You know who I am...
