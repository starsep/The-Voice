Now the courtroom is quiet, but who will confess. 
Is it true you betrayed us? The answer is Yes. 
Then read me the list of the crimes that are mine, 
I will ask for the mercy that you love to decline. 
And all the ladies go moist, and the judge has no choice, 
a singer must die for the lie in his voice. 
And I thank you, I thank you for doing your duty, 
you keepers of truth, you guardians of beauty. 
Your vision is right, my vision is wrong, 
I'm sorry for smudging the air with my song. 

Oh, the night it is thick, my defences are hid 
in the clothes of a woman I would like to forgive, 
in the rings of her silk, in the hinge of her thighs, 
where I have to go begging in beauty's disguise. 
Oh goodnight, goodnight, my night after night, 
my night after night, after night, after night, after night, after night. 

I am so afraid that I listen to you, 
your sun glassed protectors they do that to you. 
It's their ways to detain, their ways to disgrace, 
their knee in your balls and their fist in your face. 
Yes and long live the state by whoever it's made, 
sir, I didn't see nothing, I was just getting home late.
