I'm gonna take you down
Deep down, to the front line

You woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun,
Mama always said you’d be
The Chosen One.

She said: You’re one in a million
You’ve got to burn to shine,
But you were born under a bad sign,
With a blue moon in your eyes.

When you woke up this morning
All that love had gone,
Your Papa never told you
About right and wrong.

But you’re
But you’re looking good, baby,
I believe that you’re a feeling fine,(shame about it),
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes.

So sing it now

Woke up this morning
Got a blue moon
Got a blue moon in your eyes
So sad
God damn
God damned shame about it

You woke up this morning
The world turned upside down, (Lord above),
Thing’s ain’t been the same
Since the Blues walked into town.

But you’re
But you’re one in a million
You’ve got that shotgun shine. (shame about it),
Born under a bad sign,
With a blue moon in your eyes.

When you woke up this morning everything was gone.
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong.
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes,
like a voice trying to tell you there’s something you should
know. Last night you were flying but today you’re so low
- ain’t it times like these that make you wonder if
you’ll ever know the meaning of things as they appear to
the others; wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, sisters and
brothers. 
Don’t you wish you didn’t function, don’t you wish you
didn’t think beyond the next paycheck and the next little
drink? 
Well you do so make up your mind to go on, ‘cos
when you woke up this morning everything you had was gone.

Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
You want to be,
You want to be the Chosen One.
Yeah, you know it.
Just can’t help yourself, yeah.

Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
Woke up this morning,
Got yourself a gun.
Got yourself a gun.
Got yourself a gun
