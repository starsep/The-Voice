Sometimes I find I get to thinking of the past. 
We swore to each other then that our love would surely last. 
You kept right on loving, I went on a fast, 
now I am too thin and your love is too vast. 
But I know from your eyes 
and I know from your smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while. 

I choose the rooms that I live in with care, 
the windows are small and the walls almost bare, 
there's only one bed and there's only one prayer; 
I listen all night for your step on the stair. 

But I know from your eyes 
and I know from your smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while. 

Oh sometimes I see her undressing for me, 
she's the soft naked lady love meant her to be 
and she's moving her body so brave and so free. 
If I've got to remember that's a fine memory. 

And I know from her eyes 
and I know from her smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while.
