Tell me again when I have been to the river and I have taken the edge of my
Thirst.
Tell me again we are alone and I'm listening, listening so hard that it
Hurts.

Chorus
Tell me again when I'm clean and I'm sober,
Tell me again when I see through the whore.
Tell me again, tell me over and over, tell me that you want me then.
Amen, amen, amen, amen

Tell me again when the victims are singing and the laws of remorse are
Restored
Tell me again that you know what I'm thinking, vengeance belongs to the
Bored.

Chorus

Tell me again when the victims are singing and the laws of remorse are
Restored.
Tell me again that you know what I'm thinking, vengeance belongs to the
Bored.

Chorus

Tell me again when the day?it is dying?, and the night has no right to be
Here.
Try me again when the angels are panting and scratching at the door to come
In.

Chorus
