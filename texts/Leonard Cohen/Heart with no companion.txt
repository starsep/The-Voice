I greet you from the other side 
Of sorrow and despair 
With a love so vast and shattered 
It will reach you everywhere 
And I sing this for the captain 
Whose ship has not been built 
For the mother in confusion 
Her cradle still unfilled 

For the heart with no companion 
For the soul without a king 
For the prima ballerina 
Who cannot dance to anything 

Through the days of shame that are coming 
Through the nights of wild distress 
Tho' your promise count for nothing 
You must keep it nonetheless 

You must keep it for the captain 
Whose ship has not been built 
For the mother in confusion 
Her cradle still unfilled 

For the heart with no companion ... 

I greet you from the other side ...
