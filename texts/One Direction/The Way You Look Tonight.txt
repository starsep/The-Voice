There was a time
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun
And I need to tell you
How you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight
You shine just like a beacon on the bay

And I can't explain
But there's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
Cause there's something about the way you look tonight
Girl You takes my breath away
The way you look tonight
