Liam:
Front pages all your pictures
They make you look so small
How could someone not miss you at all?

Harry:
I never would mistreat you
Oh I'm not a criminal
I speak a different language
But I still hear your call

All:
Diana
Let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely
You donâ€™t even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana
Let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize&nbsp;
Baby you'd be saving mine

Niall:
It's only been four months but
You've fallen down so far
How could someone mislead you at all

Louis:
I wanna reach out for ya
I wanna break these walls
I speak a different language
But I still hear you call

All:
Diana
Let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely
You don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana
Let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize&nbsp;
Baby you'd be saving mine

Harry:
We all need something
This can't be over now
If I could hold you
Swear I'd never put you down

All:
Diana
Let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely
You don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana
Let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize&nbsp;
Baby you'd be saving mine
Oh oh oh
Diana
Oh oh oh
Diana

Harry:
Baby you'd be saving mine

All:
Oh oh oh
Diana
Oh oh oh
Diana

All:
Baby you'd be saving mine
