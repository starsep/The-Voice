Liam:
Momma they told me I should go and get some therapy
I asked 'Hey, doctor can you found out what is wrong with me?'
I don't know why I want to be with every girl I meet
I can not control it
Yeah, I know it's taking over me
I'm going crazy
Can't contain it

Zayn:
So tell me just what I should to

All:
She said 'Hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?'
Do not look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
She said 'Hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive'

Niall:
Went to a party, just after the doctor talked to me
I met a girl and took her hand out to the balcony
I whisper something in her ear that I just can't repeat
She said okay, but she was worried what her friends will think

Liam:
She's going crazy
Can't contain it

Zayn:
She asked what should I do?

All:
I said 'Hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?'
Do not look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
I said 'Hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive'

We've got to live before we get older
Do what we like
We've got nothing to lose
Shake up the way of the world from your shoulders
We've got nothing to prove

Liam:
I said 'Hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?'
Do not look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight 
(tonight, tonight)

All:
I said 'Hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?'
Do not look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
I said 'Hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive'
