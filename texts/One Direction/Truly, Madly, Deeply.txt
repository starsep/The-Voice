Liam:
Am I asleep, am I awake or somewhere in between?
I can’t believe that you are here and lying next to me
Or did I dream that we were perfectly entwined
Like branches on a tree or twigs caught on a vine

Niall:
Like all those days and weeks and months I tried to steal the kiss
And all those sleepless nights and all those daydreams where I pictured this
I’m just the underdog that finally got the girl
And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world

All:
Truly madly deeply I am foolishly completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby say you’ll always keep me
Truly madly crazy deeply in love with you
In love with you

Liam:
Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed?
And wake you up with all those words that I still haven’t said
And tender touches just to show you how I feel
Or should I act so cool like it was no big deal?

Zayn:
Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
Oor put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
Cause here’s the tragic truth, if you don’t feel the same
My heart would fall apart if someone said your name 

All:
Truly madly deeply I am foolishly completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby say you’ll always keep me
Truly madly crazy deeply in love with you
In love with you

Louis:
I hope I’m not a causality
I hope you won’t get up and leave 
It might not mean that much to you
But to me, it’s everything 
everything

All:
Truly madly deeply I am foolishly completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby say you’ll always keep me
Truly madly crazy deeply in love (in love) with you (with you)
In love (in love) with you (with you)
in love (in love) with you (with you)
With you, oh
