Harry
Circles, we’re going in circles
Dizzie’s all it makes us
We know where it takes us
We’ve been before
Closer, maybe looking closer
There’s more to discover
Find out what went wrong without blaming each other

Zayn
Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Gotta make up our minds

All
Or else we play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same
But we’re making all the same mistakes

Liam
Wake up, we both need to wake up
Maybe if we face up to this
We can make it through this
Closer, maybe we’ll be closer
Stronger than we were before, yeah
Make this something more, yeah

Zayn
Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Gotta make up our minds

All
Or else we play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same
But we’re making all the same mistakes

Yeah, yeah, that’s what crazy is
When it’s broke and, you say there’s nothing to fix
And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay
While you’re making all the same mistakes

Liam
Don’t look back
But if we don’t look back
We’re only learning then
How to make all the same, same mistakes again

All
So we play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same
But we’re making all the same mistakes

Yeah, yeah, that’s what crazy is
When it’s broke and you say there’s nothing to fix
And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay
While you’re making all the same mistakes
