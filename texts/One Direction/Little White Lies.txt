Harry:
If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your, little white lies, little white lies

Liam:
You say it's getting late, it's getting late
And don't know if you could stay, if you could stay
But you, you don't tell the truth, no
You, you like playing games

Louis:
Your hands're touching me, they're touching me
And your eyes keep saying things
They're saying what we do
When it's only me and you
I can't concentrate

Niall:
That's all I'm thinking about
All I keep thinking about
Everything else just fades away

Harry:
If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your, little white lies, little white lies

All:
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your, little white lies, little white lies
With your, little white lies, little white lies

Zayn:
Backseat of the cab, we're in the cab now
Lips getting so attached, they're so attached now
You wannna make some rules now
Cool, then we'll watch them break
Tonight,

Niall:
I know what you want
And I've been waiting so long

Harry:
If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your, little white lies, little white lies

All:
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your, little white lies, little white lies
With your, little white lies, little white lies

Zayn:
I know you want it
I know you feel it too
Let's stop pretending
That you don't know what I don't know
Just what we came to do (what we came to do)

All:
If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your, little white lies, little white lies

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your, little white lies, little white lies
With your, little white lies, little white lies
