Harry:
Her name is Noel
I have a dream about her
She rings my bell
I got gym class in half an hour
Oh how she rocks
In Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me

Wszyscy:
Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me

Niall:
Her boyfriend's a dick
He brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick
My ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block
And he drives an Iroc
But he doesn't know who I am
And he doesn't give a damn about me

Wszyscy:
Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me

Zayn:
Oh Yeeah dirtbag, no she doesn't know what she's missin
Oh Yeeah dirtbag, no she doesn't know what she's missin

Louis:
Man I feel like mold
It's prom night and I am lonely
Low and behold
She's walking over to me
This must be fake
My lips starts to shake
How does she know who I am
And why does she give a damn about me

Liam:
I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby like you

Wszyscy:
Oh Yeeah dirtbag, no she doesn't know what she's missin
Oh Yeeah dirtbag, no she doesn't know what she's missin
