Liam: 
Easy come, easy go 
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Should have know you was trouble from the first kiss
Had you're eyes wide open, why were they open?

Niall: 
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash, 
You tossed it in the trash*, you did
To give me all your love is all i eve asked 'cause
What you don't understand

Harry: 
Is I'll catch a grenade for ya 
(Zayn,Louis,Niall&amp;Liam: Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Throw my hand on the blade for ya

(Zayn,Louis,Niall&amp;Liam: Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

(Zayn,Louis,Niall&amp;Liam: Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby 
But you won't do the same

Tell the devil I said 'Hey' when you'll get back to where you're from

Yeah, you'll smile in my face 
Then rip the breaks out my car

* Podczas koncertu w Cardiff 10/4/11 Niall zamiast słowa "trash" zaśpiewał "bin" , natomiast Louis zaśpiewał "mess" .
**Podczas tego samego koncertu (wymienionego powyżej) Harry zmienił słowo "blade" na "spade" .
P.S. Zamiana słów była celowa .
