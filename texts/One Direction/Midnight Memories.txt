One, two, three

Harry:
Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
Big house party with the crowded kitchen 
People talk shh but we don't listen

Louis:
Tell me that I'm wrong
But I do what I please
Way too many pleople in the Alison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need
Oh woah

All:
Midnight Memories, oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumblin in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight Memories, oh oh oh
Anywhere we go
Never saying no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

Liam:
5 Foot something with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby follow me

Niall:
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way
Same old shh but a different day

Louis:
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Allison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, 
Oh woah

All:
Midnight Memories, oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumblin in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight Memories, oh oh oh
Anywhere we go
Never saying no
Just do it, do it, do it

Niall:
You and me and all our friends
I don't care how much we spend
Baby this is what the night is for

Harry:
I know nothings making sense
For tonight let's just pretend
I don't wanna stop 'so give me more

All:
Midnight Memories, oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumblin in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight Memories, oh oh oh
Anywhere we go
Never saying no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
