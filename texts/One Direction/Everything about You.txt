Liam:
You know I've always got your back girl,
So, let me be the one you come
running to, running to, r-r-running..
I say this just a matter of fact girl,
You just call my name
I'll be coming through, coming through, I'm c-coming..

Harry:
On the other side of the world,
It don't matter, 
I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two..
I still feel it every time..
It's just something that you do..
Now ask me why I want to..


Together:
It's Everything about you, you, you. !
Everything that you do, do, do. !
From the way that we touch baby,
To the way that you kiss on me. !

It's Everything about you, you, you. !
The way you make it feel, new, new, new. !
Like every party is just us two,
And there's nothing I could point to. !

It's Everything about you, you, you. !
Everything about you, you, you. !
It's everything that you do, do, do. !
It's everything about you. !


Niall:
Guess I like the way you smile, 
With your eyes,
Other guys, see it but don't realise, that it's m-my lovin. !
There's something about your laugh, 
That makes me wanna have to,
There's nothing funny, so we laugh at n-n-nothing. !

Louis:
Every minute's like the last so..
Let's just take it real slow..
Forget about the clock that's tic-tic-tickin. !

Harry:
I still feel it every time..
It's just something that you do..
Now ask me why I want to..


Together:
It's Everything about you, you, you. !
Everything that you do, do, do. !
From the way that we touch baby,
To the way that you kiss on me. !

It's Everything about you, you, you. !
The way you make it feel, new, new, new. !
Like every party is just us two,
And there's nothing I could point to. !

It's Everything about you, you, you. !
Everything about you, you, you. !
It's everything that you do, do, do. !
It's everything about you. !


Zayn:
And you have always been the only one I wanted,
And I wanted you to know without you,
I Can't face it. !
All we wanna have is fun..
But they say were to young..
Let them say, what they want..

Harry:
It's Everything about you, you, you. !
Everything that you do, do, do. !
From the way that we touch baby,
To the way that you kiss on me. !
