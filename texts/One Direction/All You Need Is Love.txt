Liam: 
There's nothing you can do that can't be done, 
There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung, 
There's nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game, 
It's easy...

Harry: 
There's nothing you can make that can't be made, 
There's no one you can save that can't be saved, 
There's nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time, 
It's easy...

All:
All You need is love, 
All You need is love, 
All You need is love, love, 
Love is all you need.

Niall:
There's nothing you can know that isn't known, 
There's nothing you can see that isn't shown

Harry:
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be, 
It's easy...

All:
All you need is love, 
All you need is love, 
All you need is love, love, 
Love is all you need.


All:
Love, love, love, 
Harry:
Love is all You need.
All:
Love, love, love, 
Harry:
Love is all You need.
All:
Love, love, love, 
Harry:
Love is all You need.
All:
Love, love, love, 
Harry:
C'mon.

All:
All You need is love, 
All You need is love, 
All You need is love, love, 
Love is all You need, 
Love is all You need, 
Love is all You need, 
Love is all You need, 
Love is all You need, 
Love is all You need, 
Love is all You need.
