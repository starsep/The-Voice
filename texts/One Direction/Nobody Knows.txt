Nobody knows, 
Nobody knows, but me
That sometimes crying, 
If I could pretend that I'm asleep, 
When my tears start to fall, 
I peek out from behind these walls, 
I think Nobody knows, 
Nobody knows. 

Nobody likes, 
Nobody likes to lose their inner voice, 
The one I used to hear before my life, 
Made a choice, 
I think, Nobody knows, 
No, 
Nobody knows.

Baby, oh the secret's safe with me, 
There's nowhere else in the world, 
That I colud ever be, 
And baby don't it think like I'm all alone, 
Who's gonna be there after, 
The last angel has flown, 
And I've lost my way back home, 
I say Nobody knows. 

Tomorrow I'll be there, my friend, 
I'll wake up and start all over again, 
When everybody else is gone. 

Baby, oh the secret's safe with me, 
There's nowhere else in the world, 
That I could ever be, 
And baby, don't it think like I'm all alone, 
Who's gonna be there after, 
The last angel has flown, 
And I've lost my way back home, 
I say Nobody knows, 
Nobody knows, 
Nobody knows, but me.
