I keep playing inside my head, all that you said to me
I lie awake just to convince myself this wasn't just a dream
'Cause you were right here and I should have taken the chance
But I got so scared and I lost the moment again

It's all that I can think about, oh, you're all that I can think about

Is your heart taken? Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?

Is your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when
When I should have kissed you

I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you (x4)

Every mornin' when I leave my house, I always look for you
I see you every time I close my eyes what am I gonna do?
And all my friends say that I'm punching over my weight,
But in your eyes I saw how you were looking at me.

It's all that I can think about, oh, you're all that I can think about

Is your heart taken? Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?

Is your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when
When I should have kissed you

I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you (x4)

When you stood there, just a heartbeat away,
When we were dancing and you look up at me,
If I had know then, that I've been feeling this way,
If I could replay I will never let you go.

No, Never let you go.
Am I out of time?

Is your heart taken? Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?

Is your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when
When I should have kissed you

I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you (x4)
I should have kissed you
