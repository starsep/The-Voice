I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five-and-dime
Played 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Oh when I lock back now
The summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Ya - I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

oh yeah, back in the summer of 69.
ooohhh...

Man we were killin' time
We were young and reckless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, no!

back in the summer of 69.

back in the summer of 69 x4

Back in the summer of 69.
