Liam:
People say we shouldn’t be together
We’re too young to know about forever
But I say
They don’t know
What they’re talk - talk - talking about

Harry:
Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don’t want to wait any longer
I just want to tell the world that you’re mine, girl

All:
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew
They’d just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don’t know about, they don’t know about us

Niall:
One touch and I was a believer
Every kiss gets a little sweeter

Harry:
It’s getting better
Keeps getting better all the time, girl

All:
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew
They’d just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don’t know about, they don’t know about us

Louis:
They don’t know how special you are
They don’t know what you’ve done to my heart
They can say anything they want
Cause they don’t know us

Niall:
They don’t know what we do best
It’s between me and you
Our little secret

Zayn:
But I wanna tell them 
I wanna tell the world
That you’re mine, girl

All:
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew
They’d just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don’t know about, they don’t know about us
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew
They’d just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don’t know about, they don’t know about us

Zayn:
They don’t know about us
