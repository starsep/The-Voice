 There once was a group with Liam and Niall
Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?
They lived with Zayn and their room was vile
Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?
Did you know, Harry's such a slob?
He needs to win X Factor 'cause he can't get a job

And oh, Louis needs a boat
he dresses like he owns one 
'couse he's got no other clothes.
They really need your vote.
Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?
(Vas happenin' boys?)

Mick Jagger could be Harry's dad
Vas happenin' mum? Vas happenin' Mick?
When Liam sings he makes his face look sad
Vas happenin' song? Vas happenin' sad?
And Zayn's the master of echoes (echo, echo, echo)
And Niall was raised by leprechauns
so he won't ever grow.

And oh, Louie needs that boat
he dresses like he owns one
and it's becoming a joke.
They really need your vote.
Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?
Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?
Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?
