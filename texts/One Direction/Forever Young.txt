Liam: 
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while, 
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies,
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Harry: 
Let us die young or let us live forever,
We don't have the power but we never say never,
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip, 
The music's for the sad man.

Together: 
Forever young, I wanna be forever Young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever young.

Niall: 
Some are like water, some are like the heat,
Some are a melody and some are the beat,
Sooner or later they all will be gone,
Why don't they stay young?

Harry: 
It's hard to get old without a cause,
I don't want to perish like a fading horse,
Youth is like diamonds in the sun,
And diamonds are forever...

Together: 
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever or never.
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever or never.

Liam: 
So many adventures couldn't happen today,
So many songs we forgot to play,
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue,
We let them come true.

Harry: 
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever or never.

Together: 
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever or never.
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever or never.
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever young.
