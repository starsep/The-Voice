Liam:
Been a lot of places
I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was
On the horizon
Mhm well I know, I know, I know, I know
The sun will be rising back home

Niall:
Living at the cases
Packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was
On the horizon
Uh well I know, I know, I know, I know
The moon will be rising back home

One Direction:
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone - don't
You were never on your own

Niall:
And the proof is in this song

Harry:
I've been away for ages
But I got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've witten in my memory
I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh so I know, I know, I know, I know
That I'm never leaving
No, I won't go

One Direction:
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone - don't
You were never on your own

Niall:
And the proof is in this song

Louis:
Lights up
And they should be on
Even stars in the sky they're wrong

Zayn:
Short days when the nights are long
When I think of the things I've done

One Direction:
Don't matter how far I've gone
I'm always feeling like home

One Direction:
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, don't forget it, home
If you ever feel alone - don't
You were never on your own

Zayn:
Never, never, never

One Direction:
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, don't forget it, home
If you ever feel alone - don't
You were never on your own (you were never)
And the proof is in this song

Oh, don't forget it
Oh, If you ever feel alone - don't
You were never on your own (you were never)

Liam:
And the proof is in this song
Never forget it - this song

(Zayn)
Don't forget it

Liam:
No, I'll never forget it - this song

(Zayn)
You will never ...
