Niall:
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they hide to take some time

Liam:
I know how it goes
I know how it goes to wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

Harry:
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can seperate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You and I
Oh you and I

Zayn:
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground

Louis:
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
Cause they see the things in a different light like us
But they'd never tried like us

Harry:
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can seperate the two of us

Zayn:
Cause You and I

All:
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can seperate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You and I (You And I)
You and I (You and I)

We make it if we try
You were right

Harry:
Oh you and I
