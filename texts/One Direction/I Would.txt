Liam:
Lately I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head I’m your boyfriend
But that’s one thing you’ve already got

Harry:
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He’d kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain

Zayn:
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low
Baby you should know that I would

Together:
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low
Baby you should know that I would

Niall:
Back in my head we were kissing
I thought things were going alright
With a sign on my back saying ‘kick me’
Reality ruined my life

Louis:
Feels like I’m constantly playing
A game that I’m destined to lose
Cause I can’t compete with your boyfriend
He’s got 27 tattoos

Zayn:
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low
Baby you should know that I would

Together:
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low
Baby you should know that I would

Louis:
Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would?
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?

Harry:
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low
Baby you should know that I would

Louis:
Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would?
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?

Together:
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me I would, I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low
Baby you should know that I would


I would, I would yeah.
