You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads
When You walk 
Through the door
Don't need make-up
To cover Up
being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but You

Baby You light up my world
like nobody else
the way that you flip your hair
gets me overwhelmed
but when you smile at the ground
it ain't hard to tell
You don't know oh oh
You don't know, You're beautiful!
If only You saw
What I can see
You'll understand
Why I want you so desperately
Right now
I'm looking at You
And I can't believe
You don't know oh oh
You don't know, You're beautiful!
Oh oh 
That's what makes you beautiful!

So c-come on
You got it wrong
To prove 
I'm right
I put it
In a so-o-ong
I don't know why
You're being shy
And turn away
When I look into Your eye eye eyes...
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but You


Baby You light up my world
like nobody else
the way that you flip your hair
gets me overwhelmed
but when you smile at the ground
it ain't hard to tell
You don't know oh oh
You don't know, You're beautiful!
If only You saw
What I can see
You'll understand
Why I want you so desperately
Right now
I'm looking at You
And I can't believe
You don't know oh oh
You don't know, You're beautiful!
Oh oh 
That's what makes you beautiful!
