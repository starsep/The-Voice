Louis:
Yeah! One, two, three, four!

Harry:
She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low
She’s addicted to the feeling never letting go

Liam:
Let it go

Louis:
She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don’t anyone to know
That I’m the only one who gets to take her home,

Liam:
Take her home

Liam:
But everytime I tell her that I want more
She closes the door

Zayn:
She’s not afraid of all the attention
She’s not afraid of running wild
How come she’s so afraid of falling in love
She’s not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she’s so afraid of f-f-falling in love

Niall:
Maybe she’s just trying to test me
Wanna see how hard I’m gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she’s worth

Louis:
Whatcha worth

Louis:
Maybe all her friends have told her
Don’t’ get closer he’ll just break your heart

Niall:
But either way she sees in me and it’s just so hard

Liam:
So hard

Liam:
Cuz’ every time I tell her how I feel
She says it’s not real

Zayn:
She’s not afraid of all the attention
She’s not afraid of running wild
How come she’s so afraid of falling in love
She’s not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she’s so afraid of f-f-falling in love

Harry:
What about all the things we said
Talking on the phone so late
I can’t let her get away from me, oh

Zayn:
When I say I can’t do it no more
She’s back in my door

All:
She’s not afraid of all the attention
She’s not afraid of running wild
How come she’s so afraid of falling in love
She’s not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she’s so afraid of f-f-falling in love

Zayn:
She’s not afraid
She’s not afraid
