Zayn:
Your hand fits in mine, like it’s made just for me
But bear this in mind it was meant to be
And I’m joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me...

Liam:
I know you’ve never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you you smile
You’ve never loved your stomach or your thighs 
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine 
But I’ll love them endlessly

Zayn &amp; Liam:
I won’t let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do
It’s you (Oh it’s you) they add up to 
I’m in love with you, and all these little things

Louis:
You can’t go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that’s the reason you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me

Harry:
I know you’ve never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans 
But you’re perfect to me...

Harry &amp; Niall:
I won’t let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it’s true, it’s you
It’s you they add up to 
I’m in love with you and all these little things

Niall:
You’ll never love yourself half as much as I love you
You’ll never treat yourself right darling
But I want you to
If I let you know I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you oh

Harry:
I’ve just let these little things slip out of my mouth
Because it’s you, oh it’s you, it’s you they add up to 
And I’m in love with you and all these little things 

All:
I won’t let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it’s true, it’s you
It’s you they add up to 
I’m in love with you and all your little things
