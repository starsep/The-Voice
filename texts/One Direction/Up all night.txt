It feels like we've been living in fast-foward
Another moment passing by 
(up-up-up all night)
The party's ending but it's now or never
Nobody's going home tonight 
(up-up-up all night)

Katy Perry's on replay, 
She's on replay,
DJ got the floor to shake 
The floor to shake 
People going all the way 
Yeah, all the way 
I'm still wide awake

I wanna stay up all night
And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling
And don't let it go
'Cause we got the flow now
Get out of control
I wanna stay up all night
And do it all with you

Up all night
Like this, all night, hey!
Up all night
Like this, all night, hey!
Up all night

Don't even care about the table breaking
We only wanna have a laugh
(up-up-up all night)
I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope she wanna kiss me back
(up-up-up all night)
