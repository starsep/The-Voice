Harry:
Maybe it’s the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards
Just like she already owned it

Zayn:
I said "Can you give it back to me?"
She said "Never, in your wildest dreams"

Wszyscy:
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can’t remember
How it goes, but I know
That I won’t forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh oh oh
I think it went yeah yeah yeah
I think it goes
Ohhhh

And her daddy was a dentist

Harry:
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

Niall:
I said "Can I take you home with me?"
She said "Never, in your wildest dreams"

Wszyscy:
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can’t remember
How it goes, but I know
That I won’t forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh oh oh
I think it went yeah yeah yeah
