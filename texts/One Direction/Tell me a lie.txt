Liam:
Can't ever get it right
No matter how hard I try
And I've tried

Zayn:
Well, I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives
And I'm tired
As you break my heart again this time

wszyscy: 
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and

Liam:
Tell me a lie

Liam:
Well you're the charming type
That little twinkle in your eye
Gets me every time

Harry:
And well there must have been a time
I was the reason for that smile
So keep in mind

Liam:
As you take what's left of you and I

wszyscy: 
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and 

Liam and Zayn:
Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie... Tell me a lie... Tell me a lie...

wszyscy: 
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and

Liam and Zayn:
Tell me a lie

Tell me a lie... Tell me a lie... Tell me a lie...

Tell me a lie
