Zayn: 
My hands, your hands
Tied up like two ships drifting, 
Weightless waves try to break it
I'd anything to save it
Why is it so hard to say it?

Liam:
My heart, your heart
Sit tight like book ends
Pages between us
Written with no end
So many words we’re not saying
Don’t wanna wait till its gone
You make me Strong

Wszyscy:
I’m sorry if I say I need ya
But I don’t care, I’m not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong? 

Harry:
That you make me Strong

Louis: 
Think of how much love that’s been wasted
People always trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there’s nothing I’m running from
You make me Strong

Wszyscy: 
I’m sorry if I say I need ya
But I don’t care, I’m not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

Zayn: 
So baby hold on to my heart,
Need you to keep me from falling apart
I’ll always hold on
'Cause you make me Strong

Niall: 
I’m sorry if I say I need ya
But I don’t care, I’m not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

Wszyscy: 
I’m sorry if I say I need ya
But I don’t care, I’m not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
That you make me Strong

Wszyscy: 
I’m sorry if I say, I need ya
But I don’t care, I’m not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

Harry: 
That you make me Strong
