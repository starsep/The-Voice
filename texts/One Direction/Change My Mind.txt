Louis:
The end of the night
We should say goodbye
But we carry on
While everyone’s gone

Zayn:
Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I’m walking towards the door
I’m not sure

Liam:
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So baby if you say you’ll want me to stay,
Stay for the night
I’ll change my mind

Liam:
Lean in when you laugh,
We take photographs
There’s no music on
But we dance along

Harry:
Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I’m walking towards the door
I’m not sure

All:
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So baby if you say you’ll want me to stay,
Stay for the night

Zayn:
I’ll change my mind
I’ll change my mind

Niall:
Baby if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind

All:
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So baby if you say you’ll want me to stay
Stay for the night

Zayn:
I’ll change my mind
