There was a time, 
I was everything and nothing all in one. 
When You found me, 
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun. 
And I need to tell, 
How You light up every second of the day. 
But in the moonlight
You shine just like a beacon on the bay. 

And I can't explain, 
But There' something about the way You look tonight.
Takes my breath away, 
It's that feeling I get about You deep inside. 
And I can't describe, 
Cause There's something about the way You look tonight. 
Girl, You take my breath away, 
The way You look tonight.
