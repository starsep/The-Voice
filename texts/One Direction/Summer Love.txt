Zayn:
Can’t believe your packin your bags
Tryin so hard not to cry
Had the best time and now its the worst time
But we have to say goodbye

Harry:
Don’t promise that you’re gonna write
Though promise that you’ll call
Just promise that you won’t forget we had it all

Niall:
Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it’s nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

Louis:
Wish that we could be alone now
If we could find some place to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind

Liam:
Don’t say the word that’s on your lips
Don’t look at me that way
Just promise you’ll remember
When the tide is grey

Niall:
Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know its nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

Zayn:
So please don’t make this any harder
We can’t take this any farther
And I know there’s nothin that I wanna change, change

All:
Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know its nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love
