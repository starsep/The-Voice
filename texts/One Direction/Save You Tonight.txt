Louis:
I, I wanna save you, wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break you, leave you torn apart oh

Liam:
It's a quarter to three, can't sleep at all
He's so over-rated
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall
And he wouldn't take it

Harry:
All that you want in under your nose
You should open your eyes, but they stay closed, closed

Louis:
I, I wanna save you, wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break you, leave you torn apart

Together:
Oh, I can't be no superman
But for you I'll be superhuman
I, I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight

Zayn:
Oh, now you're at home and he don't call
Cause he don't adore ya
To him you are just another doll
And I tried to warn ya

Harry:
What you want, what you need has been right here
I can see that you are holding back those tears, tears

Louis:
I, I wanna save you, wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break you, leave you torn apart

Together:
Oh, I can't be no superman
But for you I'll be superhuman
I, I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight

Louis:
Up, up and away, I'll take you with me
Up, up and away, I'll take you with me

Louis:
I, I wanna save you, wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break you, leave you torn apart

Together:
Oh, I can't be no superman
But for you I'll be superhuman
I, I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight
I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight
I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight
