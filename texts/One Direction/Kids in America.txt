Lookin' out a dirty old window, 
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by, 
I sit here alone and I wonder why. 

Friday night and everyone's moving, 
I can feel the heat but it's shooting, heading down, 
I search for the beat in this dirty town.

Down town the young ones are going, 
Down town the young ones are growing. 

We're the kids in America, 
We're the kids in America, 
Everybody live for the music - go - round.

Bright lights, the music gets faster, 
Look, girl don't check on your watch, not another glance. 
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance. 

Hot - shot, give me no problems, 
Much later, baby you'll be saying never mind, 
You know life is cruel, life is never kind.

Kind hearts don't make a new story, 
Kind hearts don't grab any glory.

We're the kids in America, 
We're the kids in America, 
Everybody live for the music - go - round.

Na, na, na , na , na, na, na, sing
Na, na , na, na, na, na, sing
Na, na, na, na, na, na , na, sing
Na, na, na, na, na, na.

We're the kids, we're the kids, we're the kids in America, 
We're the kids, we're the kids, we're the kids in America.

We're the kids in America, 
We're the kids in America, 
Everybody live for the music - go - round.
