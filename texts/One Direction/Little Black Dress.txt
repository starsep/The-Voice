 Little Black Dress just walked into the room
Making heads turn, can't stop looking at you
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright to know
Little Black Dress did you come here alone?
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright to know
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright to know

I want to see the way you move for me baby
I want to see the way you move for me baby
I want to see the way you move for me

Little Black Dress who you doing it for?
Little Black Dress I can't take anymore
It's not right, it's not right, it's not right to know
Little Black Dress what's your favourite song?
Little Black Dress I won't do you no harm
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright to know
It's alright, it's alright, 'cause I'll take you home

I want to see the way you move for me baby
I want to see the way you move for me baby
I want to see the way you move for me

[Instrumental]

I want to see the way you move for me baby
I want to see the way you move for me baby
I want to see the way you move for me

I want to see the way you move for me baby
I want to see the way you move for me baby
I want to see the way you move for me
