Harry:
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days

Liam:
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

Zayn:
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

Harry:
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
Is frozen (All: the story of, the story of)
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (All: the story of, the story of)

Niall:
Written in these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage

Liam:
I know that in the morning now I'll see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken my heart is untamed still

Louis:
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between

Harry:
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
Is frozen (All: the story of, the story of)
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (All: the story of, the story of)

Zayn:
And I been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds

Niall:
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
Is frozen

All:
The story of my life I give her hope (Zayn: give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Harry:
The story of my life
