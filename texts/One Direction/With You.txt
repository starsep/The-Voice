Verse

I see you smiling holding hands 
From the corner of my eye
Don't think i'll ever understand
Why it should be, when it should be me

Pre chorus

Girl but you should know how i feel
What it is, is to real to ignore, yeah
He means it when he says he loves you
I swear i can love you so much more

Chorus

But i can never find the words to say
When im around you 
I just don't know what to do
But you don't know that your the only girl
Who's got me falling, falling, falling 
In love with you

Verse ii

Tell me what i gotta do
Cause i want you the way he does
But i'm invisible to you
So you won't see, what you mean to me

Pre chorus

Girl but you should know how i feel
What it is, is to real to ignore, yeah
He means it when he says he loves you
I swear i can love you so much more

Chorus repeat

Bridge

You take my breath away 
Its such a cliche
But day after day
Thats what you do girl
What he's got is ours
Now i'm counting the hours 
Tell me how can i live like this

Chorus repeat
