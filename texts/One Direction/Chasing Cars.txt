Liam:
We'll do it all 
Everything 
On our own 
We don't need 
Anything 
Or anyone 

All:
If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lay with me and just forget the world? 

Harry:
Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads

All:
If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lay with me and just forget the world? 
Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old 
Show me a garden that's bursting into life 

Harry:
Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads
