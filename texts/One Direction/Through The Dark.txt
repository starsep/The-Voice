Liam:
You tell me that you sat and lost your way
You tell me that your tears are here to stay
But I know you're only hiding
And I just wanna see ya
You tell me that you're hurt, and you're in pain
And I can see your head is held in shame
But I just wanna see you smile again
See you smile again

Niall:
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
And I'll be here for you

All:
Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We will find our way through the dark

Zayn:
I wish that I could take you to the star
I'd never let you fall and break your heart
And if you wanna cry or fall apart
I'll be there to hold ya

Louis:
You tell me that you heard it's all in vain
But I can see your heart can love again
And I remember you were laughing
So let's just laugh again

Niall:
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you, back to you

All:
Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We'll find a way through the dark

Zayn:
And you don't need
You do not need to rush
And you will see it's easy to be loved
I know you wanna be loved

Liam:
Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love

All:
Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We'll find a way through the dark

Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We'll find a way through the dark
