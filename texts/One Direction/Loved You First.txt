Liam:
Girl it should be me, driving to your house
Knocking on the door, kissing you on the mouth
Holding on your hand, dancing in the dark
Cuz’ I was the only one who loved from the start

Harry:
But now when I see you with him
It tears my world apart

All:
I’ve been waiting, all this time, but finally say it
But now I see your hearts been taking
And nothing could be worse, baby I loved you first
Had my chances, could’ve been what he is
Standing, that’s what hurts the most
Girl I came so close, but now you’ll never know

Harry:
Baby I loved you first

Louis:
Girl it should be me, calling on your phone
Saying that I’m the one, and that I’ll never let you go

Harry:
I never understood, what love was really like
But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes

Liam:
But now when I see you with him
My whole world falls apart

All:
I’ve been waiting, all this time, but finally say it
But now I see your hearts been taking
And nothing could be worse, baby I loved you first
Had my chances, could’ve been what he is
Standing, that’s what hurts the most
Girl I came so close, but now you’ll never know
Baby I loved you first

Zayn:
The first touch, the first kiss
The first girl to make me feel like this
Heart break, killing me
I loved you first why can’t you see

Niall:
I’ve been waiting, all this time, but finally say it
But now I see your hearts been taking
And nothing could be worse

Zayn:
Baby I loved you first

All:
Had my chances, could’ve been what he is
Standing, that’s what hurts the most
Girl I came so close, but now you’ll never know

Zayn:
Baby I loved you first
Baby I loved you first
Baby I loved you first, oh yeah

All:
Baby I loved you first
