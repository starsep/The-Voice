I'm broken do you hear me
I'm blinded cause you are everything i see
I'm dancing, alone
I'm praying that your heart will just turn around
And as i walk up to your door
My head turns to fave the floor
Cause i can't look you in the eyes and say



When hi open his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
Cause i can love you more than this, yeah
When hi lays you down i might just die inside
It just don't feel right
Cause i can love you more than this
Can love you more than this



If i'm louder
Would you see me
Would you lay down
In my arms and rescue me
Cause we are the same
You saved me
When you leave it's gone again



And then i see you on the street
In his arms, i get weak
My body fails i'm on my kneese
praying!



When he open his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
Cause i can love you more than this,yeah
When hi lays you down i might just die inside
It just don't feel right
Cause i can love you more than this



I've never had to words to say
But now i'm asking you to stay
For a little while inside my arms
And as you close your eyes tonigt
I pray that you will see the light
That's shining from the stars above



When hi open his arms and holds you close tonight
Iy just won't feel right
Cause i can love you more than this
(cause i can love you more than this!)



When hi lays you down i might just die inside
It just don't feel right
Cause i can love you more than this,yeah
When hi open his arms and holds you colse tonight
It just won't feel right
Cause i can love you more than this
When he lays you down i might just die inside
It just don't feel right
Cause i can love you more than this
Can love you more than this
