Liam:
Said I’d never leave her cause her hands fit like my tshirt,
Tongue tied over three words, cursed.
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt,
Bodies intertwined with her lips

Niall:
Now she’s feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a polo
And it’s no joke to me 
So we can we do it all over again

All:
If you’re pretending from the start like this, 
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart 
So we can start it all over again

Harry:
Can we take the same road two days in the same clothes
And I know just what she’ll say if I make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute
You know, I can tell that your heart isn’t in it or with it

Louis:
Tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we’re together or apart
We can both remove the masks and admit we regret it from the start

All:
If you’re pretending from the start like this,
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

Zayn:
You’ll never know how to make it on your own
And you’ll never show weakness for letting go
I guess you’re still hurt if this is over
But do you really want to be alone?

Liam:
If you’re pretending from the start like this,
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me

All:
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
If you’re pretending from the start like this,
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
