Harry: 
You don’t understand, you don’t understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be, but a twist of fate
Made it so we had to walk away

Niall: 
'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We’re on fire now

Zayn: 
Yeah, we’re on fire, we are on fire
We’re on fire now

(Harry: One, two, three!)

Wszycy:
I don’t care what people say when we’re together
You know I wanna be the one who hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on 

Harry:
Baby be with me so happily

Liam: 
It’s 4am, and I know that you’re with him
I wonder if he knows that I've touched your skin

Louis: 
And if he feels my traces in your hair
I’m sorry love, but I don’t really care

Niall: 
'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We’re on fire now

Zayn: 
Yeah, we’re on fire, we are on fire
We’re on fire now

(Harry: One, two, three!)
