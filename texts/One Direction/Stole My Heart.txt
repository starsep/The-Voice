The night shines
It's getting hot on my shoulders
I don't mind, this time, it doesn't matter 
'Cause your friends
They look good and you look better
Don't you know all night
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come around, 'round, 'round

Under the lights tonight
You turned around
And you stole my heart
With just one look
When I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute, girl
To steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you

I'm weaker 
My words fall and they hit the ground
Oh life, come on head
Don't you fail me now
(Don't you fail me now)
I start to say
I think I love you, but I make no sound
You know cause all my life I've been waiting
For a girl like you to come around, 'round, 'round

Under the lights tonight
You turned around
And you stole my heart
With just one look
When I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute, girl
To steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you

There is no other place that I would rather be
Than right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground , I put my arms around you
And we can stay here tonight
There's so much that I wanna say
I wanna say

Under the lights tonight
You turned around
And you stole my heart
With just one look
When I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute, girl
To steal my heart tonight

Under the lights tonight
You turned around
And you stole my heart
With just one look
When I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute, girl
To steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you
Been waiting for a girl like you
