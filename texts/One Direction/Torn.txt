I thought I saw a girl brought to life, 
She was warm, she came around, like she was dignified,
She showed me what it was to cry, 
You couldn't be that girl, I adored. 
You don't seem to know, seem to care, what your heart is for,
But I don't know her anymore.
There's nothing left I used to cry, 
My conversation has run dry, 
That's what's goin' on, 
Nothing's fine. I'm torn...

I'm all out of faith, 
This is how I feel, 
I'm cold and I'm shamed, 
Lying naked on the floor.
Illusion never changed, 
Into something real. 
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn, 
You're a little late, I'm already torn...
I'm already torn...

There's nothing left I used to cry, 
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's goin' on
Nothing's fine. I'm torn...
You're a little late, I'm already torn..
I'm already, I'm already torn...
Torn...
