She's not a girl who misses much 
Do do do do do do do do 
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand 
Like a lizard on a window pane. 

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors 
On his hobnail boots 
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy 
Working overtime 
A soap impression of his wife which he ate 
And donated to the Nation Trust. 

I need a fix 'cause I'm going down 
Down to the bits that I left uptown 
I need a fix cause I'm going down 
Mother Superior jump the gun 
Mother Superior jump the gun 
Mother Superior jump the gun 
Mother Superior jump the gun. 

Happiness is a warm gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 
When I hold you in my arms 
And I feel my finger on your trigger 
I know no one can do me no harm 
Because happiness is a warm gun 
Yes it is.
