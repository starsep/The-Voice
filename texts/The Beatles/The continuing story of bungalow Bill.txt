Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill 
Bungalow Bill? 

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun 
In case of accidents he always took his mom 
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son. 
All the children sing 

Hey Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill 
Bungalow Bill? 

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies 
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise 
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes 
All the children sing 

Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill 
Bungalow Bill? 

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin 
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in 
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him 
All the children sing 

Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill 
Bungalow Bill?
