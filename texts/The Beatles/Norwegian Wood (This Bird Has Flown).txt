I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me

She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood?



She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere

So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chairI sat on the rug, biding my time, drinking her wine

We talked until two and then she said, It's time for bedShe told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh

I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bathAnd when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown

So I lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood?
