This happened once before, 
When I came to your door, 
No reply. 
They said it wasn't you, 
But I saw you peep through your window, 
I saw the light, I saw the light, 
I know that you saw me, 
'cause I looked up to your face. 

I tried to telephone, 
They said you were not home, 
That's a lie, 
'cause I know where you've been, 
I saw you walk in your door, 
I nearly died, I nearly died, 
'cause you walked hand in hand 
With another man in my place. 

If I were you'd realize that I 
Love you more than any other guy, 
And I'll forgive the lies that I 
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

No reply, no reply.
