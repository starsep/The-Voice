Love, Love, Love
Love, Love, Love
Love, Love, Love

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy...

Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

Chorus:

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Repeat chorus

Nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy...

Repeat chorus

All you need is love (All together, now!)
All you need is love (Everybody!)
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need (Love is all you need) [repeat]

Yee-hai!
Oh yeah!
She loves you, yeah yeah yeah
She loves you, yeah yeah yeah

Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
