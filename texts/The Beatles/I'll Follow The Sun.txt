One day
You'll look to see I've gone,
For tomorrow may rain so
I'll follow the sun.

Some day
You'll know I was the one.
For tomorrow may rain so
I'll follow the sun.

And now the time has come,
And so, my love I must go.
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know...

Oh, one day
You'll find that I have gone.
For tomorrow may rain so
I'll follow the sun.

And now the time has come,
And so, my love I must go.
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know...

Oh, one day you'll find
That I have gone.
For tomorrow may rain so
I'll follow the sun.
