She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

You think you lost your love, 
When I saw her yesterday. 
It's you she's thinking of 
And she told me what to say. 
She says she loves you 
And you know that can't be bad. 
Yes, she loves you 
And you know you should be glad. Ooh! 

She said you were to know 
That she almost lost her mind. 
And now she says she knows 
You're not the hurting kind. 
She says she loves you 
And you know that can't be bad. 
Yes, she loves you 
And you know you should be glad. Ooh! 

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
And with a love like that 
You know you should be glad. 

And now it's up to you, 
I think it's only fair, 
If I should hurt you, too, 
Apologize to her 
Because she loves you 
And you know that can't be bad. 
Yes, she loves you 
And you know you should be glad. Ooh! 

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
And with a love like that 
You know you should be glad.
