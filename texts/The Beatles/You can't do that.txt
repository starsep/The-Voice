I've got somethin' to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talkin' to that boy again
I’m gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
oh, You can't do that

Well it’s the second time I’ve caught you talkin' to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it’s a sin
I think I'll let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
oh, You can’t do that

Everybody’s greeeen
Cuz I'm the one who won your love
But if they seeee
You talking that way, They'll Laugh in my face

So Please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I can’t help my feelings I'll go out of my mind
I gonna I’ll let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (gonna let you down and leave you flat).
Because I told you before, 
oh You can’t do that!
