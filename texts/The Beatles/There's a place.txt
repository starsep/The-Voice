There, there's a place
where I can go
when I feel low
when I feel blue
And it's my mind
and there's time
When I'm alone
I think of you
the things you do
Go round my head
the things you've said 

Like I love only you
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so 

There, there's a place
where I can go
when I feel low
when I feel blue
And it's my mind
and there's time. When I'm alone
There's a place
There's a place
