How do you do what you do to me?*

I wish I knew.

If I knew how you do it to me,

I'd do it to you.



How do you do what you do to me?

I'm feeling blue.

Wish I knew how you do it to me,

But I haven't a clue.



You give me a feeling in my heart, (oh la la la)**

Like an arrow passing through it.

Suppose that you think

You're very smart,

But won't you tell me how do you do it?



Repeat *

Repeat **



How do you do what you do to me?

I wish I knew.

Wish I knew how you do it to me,

But I haven't a clue.

Wish I knew how you do it to me,

I'd do it to you.

Wish I knew how you do it to me,

I'd do it to you
