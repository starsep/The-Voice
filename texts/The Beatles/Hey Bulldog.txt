Sheepdog 
Standing in the rain, 
Bullfrog 
Doing it again 
Some think that happinness is measured out in years 
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears 


Child-like 
No one understands, 
Jack knife 
In your sweaty hands, 
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles 
What makes you think you're something special when you smile 

You can talk to me x3 
if you're lonely you can talk to me 

Big man 
Walking in the park 
Whigwam 
Frightened of the dark 
Some think that happiness is measured out in you 
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue 

You can talk to me x3 
If you're lonely you can talk to me
