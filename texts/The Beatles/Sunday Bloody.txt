Well, it was Sunday Bloody Sunday 
Oh, when they shot the people there 
The cries of thirteen martyrs filled the free derry air 
Is there any one amongst you, dare to blame it on the kids?
Not a soldier boy was bleeding when they nailed the coffin lids

Sunday Bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday is the day

When you claim to be majority, well, you know that it's a lie
You're really a minority on this sweet emerald isle
When Stormont bans our marches, they've got a lot to learn
Internment is no answer, it's those mothers turn to burn

Sunday Bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday is the day
