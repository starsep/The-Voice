I should have known better with a girl like you 
That I would love everything that you do 
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do 

Whoa, whoa, I 
never realized what I kiss could be 
this could only happen to me 
Can't you see, can't you see 

That when I tell you that I love you, oh 
You're gonna say you love me too, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh 
And when I ask you to be mine 
You're gonna say you love me too 

So, oh I should have realized a lot of things before 
If this is love you gotta give me more 
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more 

Whoa whoa I never realized what I kiss could be 
This could only happen to me 
Can't you see, can't you see 

That when I tell you that I love you, oh 
You're gonna say you love me too, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh 
And when I ask you to be mine 
You're gonna say you love me too 
You love me too 
You love me too 
You love me too
