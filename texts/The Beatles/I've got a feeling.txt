I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside 
Oh yeah, Oh yeah. 
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide 
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no, 
Yeah I've got a feeling. 

Oh please believe me, I'd hate to miss the train 
Oh yeah, Oh yeah. 
And if you leave me I won't be late again 
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no. 
Yeah I've got a feeling yeah. 

All these years I've been wandering around, 
Wondering how come nobody told me 
All that I was looking for was somebody 
Who looked like you. 

Ev'rybody had a hard year 
Ev'rybody had a good time 
Ev'rybody had a wet dream, 
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine 
Oh yeah, Oh yeah. 
Ev'rybody had a good year, 
Ev'rybody let their hair down, 
Ev'rybody pulled their socks up, 
Ev'rybody put their foot down. 
Oh yeah, Oh yeah. 

Oh my soul... so odd.
