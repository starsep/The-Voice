Desmond has a barrow in the market place 
Molly is the singer in a band 
Desmond says to Molly - girl I like your face 
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.

Ob-la-di Ob-la-da life goes on bra 
Lala how the life goes on 
Ob-la-di Ob-la-da life goes on bra 
Lala how the life goes on. 

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store 
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (golden ring?)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door 
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (to sing) 

Ob-la-di Ob-la-da life goes on bra 
Lala how the life goes on 
Ob-la-di Ob-la-da life goes on bra 
Lala how the life goes on (yeah) 

In a couple of years they have built 
A home sweet home 
With a couple of kids running in the yard 
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ah ha ha ha ha ha) 

Happy ever after in the market place 
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (Arm! Leg!)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face 
And in the evening she still sings it with the band.

And in the evening she's a singer with the band.
