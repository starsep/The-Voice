If I fell in love with you 
would you promise to be true 
And help me understand 
'Cause I've been in love before 
And I've found that love is more 
That just holding hands 

If I gave my heart to you 
I must be sure from the very start 
that you would love me more than her 

If I trust in you, oh please 
don't run and hide, 
if I love you too, oh please 
don't hurt my pride like her 

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain 
And I would be sad 
If our new love was in vain 

So I hope you see that I 
would love to love you 
And that she will cry 
when she learns we are two 

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain 
And I would be sad 
If our new love was in vain 

So I hope you see that I 
would love to love you 
And that she will cry 
when she learns we are two 
If I fell in love with you
