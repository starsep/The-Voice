Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book? 
It took me years to write, will you take a look? 
Based on a novel by a man named Lear 
And I need a job, so I want to be a paperback writer,

It's the dirty story of a dirty man 
And his clinging wife doesn't understand. 
His son is working for the Daily Mail, 
It's a steady job but he wants to be a paperback writer,

It's a thousand pages, give or take a few, (Frere)
I'll be writing more in a week or two. (Jacques)
I can make it longer if you like the style, (Frere)
I can change it round and I want to be a paperback writer, (Jacques)
Paperback writer. 

If you really like it you can have the rights, (Frere)
It could make a million for you overnight. (Jacques)
If you must return it, you can send it here (Frere)
But I need a break and I want to be a paperback writer, (Jacques)
