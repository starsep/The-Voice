Everyday, I think of you,
I think a little bit more of you,
I take apart my heart,
and something inside me is destroyed.
Everyday I think of you,
I think a little bit more of you;
Everytime that the sun comes out
I look for a bit of courage
to continue this way,
And I see you;
that I didn't touch you in that way.
I pray for you every night.
It dawns and I think of you.
The tick-tock of the clocks
rumbles in my ears
and I keep thinking of you,
and I keep thinking....
