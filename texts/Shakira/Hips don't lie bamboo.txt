Perfection,
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak spanish
Como se llama (SI) bonita (SI)
Mi casa (SHAKIRA SHAKIRA) su casa
Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body
And i'm on tonight
You know my hips dont lie
And i'm starting to feel it's right
ay ay ay to the bamboooo
La gloria te esta esperando
Latino! Africano! Asiatico! Americano!
Tu Dios te esta mirando!

Eleven on the field with the heart of a gladiator

And the crowd chants, sounds like spirits from Africa
