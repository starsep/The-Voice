All of my life
Too late
'Til you showed up with perfect timing
Now here we are
We rock it
Our fingers are stuck in the socket

It's just the nature - a game
Get ready we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober

Is it true that you love me?
How dare you to kiss me?
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor...

La la la la la / x4 (truth or dare on the dance floor)

Oh oh oh oh

How dare you?
Leggo
Of all the millions on the planet
You're the one
Who's keeping me on it
You know I like you like nobody's business
Your blue Spanish eyes are my witness

It's just the nature - a game
Get ready we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober

Is it true that you love me?
How dare you to kiss me?
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor...
La la la la la / x4 (truth or dare on the dance floor)

Is it true that you love me?
How dare you to kiss me?
How dare you to touch me?
It's truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la / x4 (truth or dare on the dance floor)

Oh oh oh oh

How dare you?
