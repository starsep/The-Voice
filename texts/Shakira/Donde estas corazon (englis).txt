Where are you Love? 
Yesterday I looked for you... 
on the floor, and in the sky, Dearest... 
and I didn't find you. 
I can't think that you're hiding from me 
Because my silence is sincere... 
It says 'yes' 
Where are you oLve? 
Come, return for me... 
that my life knots like an eight... 
if you're not here.. 
I want to think... 
that you won't falter... 
because on this planet, no one else exists that I could love. 
Chorus: 
Where are you Love? 
I looked for you yesterday 
WHere are you Love? 
And I didn't find you 

Where are you Love? 
You left here.. 
Looking for who-knows what... 
so far from me... 
and I can think.... 
and continue to think... 
that you won't falter 
because on this planet.. 
no one else exists... 
that I could possibly love. 
(Repeat Chorus) 


I looked for you 
in the wardrobe 
In the phone book 
under the car 
in black and in white 
in History books 
in magazines 
and on the radio. 
I searched for you in the streets 
You're Mother's 
A bootmaker's stand(?) 
In my change purse 
In two thousand religions 
I've even looked for you in my songs
