Take off all of your skin
I'm brave when you are free
Shake off all of your sins 
Then give them to me
Closer, let me back in
I wanna' be yours, wanna' be your hero

And my heart beats...

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive 
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe

And you touch me

and I'm like... and I'm like... and I'm like...
Hooooooooo, Hooooooooo
and I'm like... Hooooooooo, Hooooooooo
and I'm like... Hooooooooo, Hooooooooo
and I'm like... Hooooooooo

I will follow you down wherever you go
I am, baby I'm bound to you and do you know?
Closer, pull me in tight
I wanna' be yours, wanna' be your hero

And my heart beats...

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe

And you touch me

and I'm like... and I'm like... and I'm like...
Hooooooooo, Hooooooooo
(We are alive) Hooooooooo, Hooooooooo
and I'm like... Hooooooooo, Hooooooooo
(We are alive) Hooooooooo, Hooooooooo

I'm just gonna' raise my head
Welcome to the final edge
And I'm gonna fall (When the stars make love to the universe)
I'm just gonna' raise my head
And hold you close

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe

And you touch me

and I'm like... and I'm like... and I'm like...
Hooooooooo, Hooooooooo
and I'm like... Hooooooooo, Hooooooooo
and I'm like... Hooooooooo, Hooooooooo
and I'm like... Hooooooooo.
