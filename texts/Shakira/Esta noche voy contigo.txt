Na na na naaaaa 
Na na na naaaaa 
Na na na na na na naaaaa 

Today I feel high as the heavens, I believe that I'm going to burst 
And I get tangled up in the time, now I don't know if you will arrive 
When I look back you are nearin.g 
My body trembles as you walk towards me. 
Radiant night on my skin 
My heart races, I am reborn. 

Chorus: 
Tonight I go with you to dance 
The moment is ours and doesn't end 
Tonight I go with you to dream 
Because the night is rhythm, it's happiness. 
Tonight I go with you to dance 
Being with you makes me free 
Tonight I go with you to dream 
Because love is ours and is enternal. 

Na na na naaaaa 
Na na na naaaaa 
Na na na na na na naaaaa 

On my way home, I am happy, I have the desire to shout 
If you wish, I will see you, you just tell me and that's all 
And I start, in the darkness 
The energy in our bodies will never stop. 
This is the rhythm that makes me vibrate 
And although I wanted to hold back I can't stop. 

Chorus (repeat)
