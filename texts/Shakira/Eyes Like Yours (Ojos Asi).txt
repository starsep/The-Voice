Oh, you know I have seen
A sky without sun
A man with no nation
Saints, captive in chains
A song with no name
For lack of imagination

ya la he ya he ya la he
And I have seen
Darker than ebony
ya he ya he ya la he
And now it seems, that I
Without your eyes could never be

My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over; the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give
Came from Bahrain, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Rabboussamai fikarrajaii
Fi ainaiha aralhayati
Ati ilaika min hatha lkaaouni
Arjouka labbi labbi nidai
Came from Bahrain, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Oh, you know I have seen
A woman of means
In rags and begging for pleasure
Crossed, a river of salt
Just after I rode a
ship that's sunk in the desert

ya la he ya he ya la he
And I have seen
Darker than ebony
ya he ya he ya la he
And now it seems, that I
Without your eyes could never be

My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over; the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give
Came from Bahrain, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Rabboussamai fikarrajaii
Fi ainaiha aralhayati
Ati ilaika min hatha lkaaouni
Arjouka labbi labbi nidai
Came from Bahrain, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Rabboussamai fikarrajaii
Fi ainaiha aralhayati
Ati ilaika min hatha lkaaouni
Arjouka labbi labbi nidai
min Bahrain ila Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over; the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give
Came from Bahrain, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours
