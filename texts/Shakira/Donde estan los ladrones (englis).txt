They've seen them around here 
they've seen them on the rooves 
giving back in Paris 
convicting in the courts 
with the powdered nose 
in a tie or in blue jeans 
they've seen them everywhere 
without anything else to say 
where are the thieves 
where is the murderer 
perhaps there flailing 
in the neighbor's patio 
and what happens if they are 
and what happens if i am 
the one who plays this guitar 
or the one who sings this song 
the one who sings this song 
they've seen them on their knees 
sitting or squating 
stopped giving lessons 
in all the positions 
preaching in the churches 
until offering concerts 
they've seen them in all the bars 
distributing ministeries 
where ar ethe thieves 
where is the murderer 
perhaps there flailing 
in the neighbor's patio 
and what happens if they are 
and what happens if i am 
the one who plays this guitar 
or the one who sings this song 
the one who sings this song
