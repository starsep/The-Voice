I'm not asking that every day be sunny
I'm not asking that there be a party every Friday
Nor do I ask you to come back begging forgiveness
If you're crying with dry eyes,
Speaking about her

Oh my love, it hurts so much
It hurts so much
That you left without saying a word
Oh my love, losing you was torture

I know I haven't been a saint
But I can make it up to you

Man doesn't live on bread alone
Nor do I live on excuses

We only learn from mistakes
And today I know my heart is yours

Better save that for yourself
Take that bone to some other dog
And let's say goodbye

I can't ask winter to spare a rose bush
I can't ask an elm tree to bear pears
I can't ask the eternal of a mere mortal
And go about casting thousands of pearls before swine

Oh my love, it hurts so much
It hurts so much
That you no longer trust my promises
Oh my love, losing you has been torture

I know I haven't been a saint
And I'm not made of stone

Man doesn't live on bread alone
Nor do I live on excuses

We only learn from our mistakes
And today I know my heart is yours

Better save that for yourself
Take that bone to some other dog
And let's say goodbye

Listen, baby, don't you go
Listen, baby, don't get angry
From Monday to Friday you have my love
Give Saturday to me and you'll be better off
Listen baby, don't punish me anymore
Without you, out there I have no peace
I'm just a repentant man
I'm the bird that returns to its nest

I know I haven't been a saint
And I'm not made of stone

Man doesn't live on bread alone
Nor do I live on excuses

We only learn from our mistakes
And today I know my heart is yours

Better save it for someone foolish enough to believe you and say Goodbye

AD LIBS

Oh after all I've done for you
It was such a torture to lose you
It hurts me so that it's like this
Keep on crying sorry
I...
I'm not going
To cry over you
