Shakira:
I left a note on my bedpost
Said: "Not to repeat yesterday's mistakes"
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory!
The way you make me feel, yeah
You gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh, here we go
You part of me now, You part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow oh!

Shakira:
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
I can't remember to forget you!
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
I can't remember to forget you!

I can't remember to forget you!

Rihanna:
I go back again fall off the train,
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I'm trying to say: "Is not to forget!"
You see only the good, selective memory!
The way he makes me feel like,
The way he makes me feel
I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh, here we go
He a part of me now, he a part of me
Shakira:
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow oh!

Shakira:
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Rihanna:
I can't remember to forget you!
Shakira:
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
Rihanna:
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
