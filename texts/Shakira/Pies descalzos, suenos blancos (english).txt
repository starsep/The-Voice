Bare Feet, White Dreams 

You bit the apple 
and rejected Paradise, 
condemed a serpent... 
When is was you that made it that way 
for milleniums and milleniums. 
You remained nude 
and you came across dinosaurs 
under a roof and without shield. 
And now you're here... 
wanting to be happy... 
When you're destiny meant squat to you... 
Chorus: 
You belonged to an ancient race 
of bare feet and white dreams. 
Dust to dust...you are dust 
thinking iron alwys softens to heat. 

You constructed an exact world 
of perfect endings. 
Every little thing calculated.. 
in its space and tmie... 
I, being a complete chaos.. 
the entries and exits 
the names and sizes... 
don't fit in my brains 
and now you're here 
wanting to be happy 
When you destiny meant squat to you. 
(Repeat Chorus) 

Greet the neighbor, 
Sleep an hour, 
Work everyday... 
to live in Life... 
Answering only that 
and feeling only this 
And may God spare us of bad thoughts, 
fullfill our duties, 
attend college. 
What would the family say 
if you were a failure? 
Always wear shoes, 
keep it down at the dinner table, 
wear hosiery to evening events 
and a tie to parties. 
Women always marry before 30. 
If not they clothe saints. 
even if you didn't want it like that. 
And to a quincenera... 
it's best not to forget 
a fine champagne... 
and to waltz your best 
waltz your best
