Let us be one and let's begin
A mistake that turns into perfection
I want to see you sliding in
My underwear

This time I plan to let you win
I'll be a victim of my own invention
Let us be one and let's begin
Once and for all

What heaven weaves and braids no man shall undo
And I've been custom-made for no one but you
You know it's now or never

I have a feeling inside
(Despacio, despacio, comienzas a caer)
And intuition's always been a woman's guide
(Te siento, te siento, desde antes de nacer)
We've been wanting each other since before we were born
(Adentro, adentro te vas quedando)
And I will love you even after I am gone
(Asi, estoy dispuesta a todo por)

This time I plan to let you win
I'll be here in full subordination

I'll be devoted to your will
Once and for all

Love is only pain disguised as a kiss
So make me feel it now
Let's get on with this
And the sooner the better

I have a feeling inside
(Despacio, despacio, comienzas a caer)
And intuition's always been a woman's guide
(Te siento, te siento, desde antes de nacer)
We've been wanting each other since before we were born
(Adentro, adentro te vas quedando )
And I will love you even after I am gone
(Asi, estoy dispuesta a todo)

I have a feeling inside
(Despacio, despacio comienzas a caer )
And intuition's always been a woman's guide
(Te siento, te siento desde antes de nacer)
We've been wanting each other since before we were born
(despacio, adentro te vas quedando )
And I will love you even after I am gone
After I am gone...
