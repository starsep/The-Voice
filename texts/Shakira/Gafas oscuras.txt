Your sunglasses make me vibrate 
Every time that they hid eyou 
Your sunglasses make me feel 
That I'm from in another place 

And when you look at me my body shrinks 
And I become small 
And when you look at me 
I feel different 

Your sunglasses make me little 
And I don't know what happens 
Your sunglasses, intriguing, mysterious 
To everyone. 

And when you look at me I become blind 
And you steal my soul 
You stop time, you stop my mind 
And the calm dies 
And its all the fault 
Of your sunglasses 

Chorus: 
Carry me, hide me in your sunglasses 
That are..., that look at me passionately 
Carry me, hide me in your sunglasses 
Help build up fantasies in my mind 

Your dark sunglasses make me little 
And I don't know what happens 
Your sunglasses, intriguing, mysterious 
To everyone. 

And when you look at me I become blind. 
And you steal my soul 
You stop time, you stop my mind 
And the calm dies 
And it's all the fault 
Of those sunglasses 

Chorus (repeat)
