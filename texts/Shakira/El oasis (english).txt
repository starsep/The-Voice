Mine is a tribute to the reconciliation of love 
Between all people there's the blessing of God 
Mine is planting the seed of pardon 
And to find that life is just an illusion 
And between my brothers and sisters 
Time and Time again they change themselves 
For flowers 
And amongst all the hate that falls at your feet 
A Hail Mary filled with faith 

Chorus: 
If our pride hurts us so much 
Breaks hearts and leaves us empty 
Resentments in your only life 
And arriving to heaven 
Resentment forgets itself in an oasis of pleasure 
In this world I want to see 
A true oasis 
Where I can love you. 

Mine is giving you my hand 
And to find in my heart 
A tender oasis where it grows 
Our love o 
Mine is to go to you side and heal your ailment 
To live even though they say its a whim 
The feelings I feel for you 


Chorus...
