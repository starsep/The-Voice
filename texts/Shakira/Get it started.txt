[Pitbull:]
To all these rappers I apologize
I know it ain’t fair,
the only ball I drop
New Years, Times Square
The world is mine
sixth sense
I see seven signs
now baby, let’s get started for life

[SHAKIRA, Chorus:]
Everytime I look into your eyes (Mr Worldwide)
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
we can get started for life (tonight)
for life (tonight) for life
we can get started for life (tonight)
for life (tonight) for life
we can get started

You know it feels right

[Pitbull:]
Big news, Pitbull
Tom Cruise, Mumbai
all lit up like a December night,
like the 4th of July, Vanilla Sky
Thrilla in Manilla
Knockin em out like Pacquiao
New Ali, new Frazier
but for now it’s off to Malaysia
Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day
Now that’s worldwide
if you think it’s a game let’s play
Dale

[SHAKIRA, Chorus:]
Everytime I look into your eyes (Mr Worldwide)
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
we can get started for life (tonight)
for life (tonight) for life
we can get started for life (tonight)
for life (tonight) for life
we can get started

You know it feels right

I am what they thought I’d never become,
I believed and became it
now I’m here to claim it
I hustle anything, you name it
I went from evictions to food stamps,
to back in work what dawn..
to a passport, flooded with stamps
now slowly, everywhere I land
Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day
Now that’s worldwide
if you think it’s a game let’s play
Dale

Cause if it feels right
we shouldn’t waste any more time
let’s get it started, don’t think about it
you know I’m gonna make alright, alright
Cause if it feels right
you know I’ve made up my mind
let’s get it started, don’t think about it
I know that we can make it alright alright

[Chorus:]
Everytime I look into your eyes (Mr Worldwide)
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
we can get started for life (tonight)
for life (tonight) for life
we can get started for life (tonight)
for life (tonight) for life
we can get started

Don’t start what you can’t finish
you know it feels right
let’s go!

you know it feels right
