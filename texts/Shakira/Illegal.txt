(featuring Carlos Santana) 

Who woul've thought that you could hurt me
the way you've done it
so deliberate, so determined
and since you have been gone
I bite my nails for days and hours
and question my own questions on and on...

So tell me now, tell me now
why you're so far away
when I'm still so close...

Chorus:
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm Sorry"
you said you would love me until you die
and as far as I know you're still alive, baby
and you don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm Sorry"
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive
a woman's heart...

I tried so hard to be attentive
to all you wanted
always supportive, always patient
what did I do wrong?
been wondering for days and hours
it's clear is isn't here where you belong...

Anyhow, anyhow
I wish you both all the best
I hope you get along...

Chorus:x2

Open heart, open heart
it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart...

Open heart, open heart
it should be illegal to deceive a womans heart...
