This new daybreak 
Is opening the door to the rest of my life 
Without knowing why 
This life doesn't pass in vain 
There is always an afterlife 
And living in this world 
Is something is hard. 

Chorus: 
I search for eternal springtime 
To revive life 
A storm of emotions 
Confuse me, dominate me. 
My life is still undecided. 
The flower that opens in day 
My first love 
I feel it straight to the heart. 

Today I discover what love is 
An embrace, a full caress 
Something more to give 
Is the dream that now sets me free 
My other truth 
At fifteen I am truly a woman. 

Chorus
