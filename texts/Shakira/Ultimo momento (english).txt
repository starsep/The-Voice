What happened to me 
Was a deep impact 
Here in my heart 
When I heard about it 
I found your gaze and your voice 
While I search for my soul 

That's the way it started 
It was delivered in the sidewalks 
This world was already in motion 
With its rotation but 
It didn't matter to us 

Now you tell me 
I like you and to keep quiet 
Underneath your glance of your gaze is a empty hole 
It's my emotion 
And when the telephone rings 
It frustrates me when its the wrong number 
No please 

Chorus: 
Extra! Extra! 
The news is that I'm in love 
Extra! Extra! 
Enough with empty days, I love you 
Extra! Extra! 
The newspapers should have proclaimed it 
Extra! Extra! 
Extra! Extra! 
Extra! Extra! 

What happened to me 
In the streets the children of God 
Were talking about altar boys 
It didn't upset me 

That's the way it happened 
Against my will you brought me love 
And the truth is that the best thing 
That happened in my life 
The mailbox is asking for your letters 

Now you tell me 
Even though metal is stronger 
Some day it will rust 
And that's what happened 

I don't know why the headlines don't forget 
And they beat at my wounds 
By hearing it
