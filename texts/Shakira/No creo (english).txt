You only know well of who i am 
and for that my heart is yours 
you only bend my right 
and for that to where you want i go 
i don't believe that someday the sea 
will lose it's salty flavor 
i still don't believe in me 
i don't believe in the chance 

i only believe in your blue smile 
en your crystal look 
the kisses that you give me 
and all that you say 

you only know well of who i am 
and for that my heart is yours 
you only bend my right 
and for that to where you want i go 
if you talk too much 
don't set aside 
that nobody will love you like that 
as for me 

i don't believe in Venus nor Mars 
i don't believe in Carl Marx 
i don't believe in Jean-Paul Sartre 
i don't believe in Brian Weiss 

i only believe in your blue smile 
en your crystal look 
the kisses that you give me 
and all that you say 

you only know well of who i am 
and for that my heart is yours 
you only bend my right 
and for that to where you want i go 
if you talk too much 
don't set aside 
that nobody will love you like that 
as for me 

oh i want to be your firmament 
in your mouth of a song 
in your wings always being in the wind 

yourc lod of salt 
a sunbeam 
that to where you say that 
you want me to go 
i go that you are my slip my happy country 
my spring 
my stairway to the sky if 
for that i continue to walk here and i walk 
withyou 
to you she never could tell you not to 

you only know well of who i am 
and for that my heart is yours 
you only bend my right 
and for that to where you want i go 

your clod of salt 
a sunbeam 
that to where you say that 
you want me to go 
i go that you are my slip my happy country 
my spring 
my stairway to the sky if 
for that i continue to walk here and i walk 
withyou 
to you she never could tell you not to 

if you talk too much 
don't set aside 
that nobody will love you like that 
as for me
