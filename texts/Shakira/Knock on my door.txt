I'm gonna obey all your wishes as if 
they were orders 
I'm gonna dye your body in kisses 
while we're growing older 
I'll be there to beat your fears in all the 
three hundred sixty five days a year 

so this is what I say 

Knock on my door 
you know I'll be in town 
come ask for more don't let me down 
what is off what is on 
what is left what is gone 
I'm gonna give it all for you baby 
you can consider it done 

I'm gonna live all my monday like the 
sunniest sundays 
I'm gonna go thru life every moment 
thinking of you always 
and again we'll beat our fears there's 
only three hundred sixty five days a 
year 

so this is what I say 

Knock on my door 
you know I'll be in town 
come ask for more don't let me down 
what is off what is on 
what is left what is gone 
I'm gonna give it all for you baby 
you can consider it done 

Knock on my door 
Knock on my door 

don't let me down 
you know I'll be in town
