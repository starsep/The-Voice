Yesterday i knew a sky without sun 
and a man without ground 
a priest in prison 
and a sad song without an owner 
ya he, ya he, ya la he 
and i knew your black eyes 
ya he, ya he, ya la he 
and now yes that 
i can't live without them i 
asked to the heavens only one wish 
that in your eyes i can live 
i've traveled the entire world 
and a thing i'm coming to say to you 
i traveled from Bahrein until Beirut 
i went from the north until the south pole 
and i didn't finds eyes like those 
like the ones you have 
rabboussamai fikarrajaii 
fi ainaiha aralhayati 
ati ilaika min haza lkaaouni 
arjouka labbi labbi nidai 
i went from the north until the south pole 
and i didn't finds eyes like those 
like the ones you have 
yesterday i saw a passing woman 
underneath her camel 
a salt river, a boat 
abandoned in the desert 
ya he, ya he, ya la he 
and i saw your black eyes 
ya he, ya he, ya la he 
and now yes that 
i can't live without them i 
asked to the heavens only one wish 
that in your eyes i can live 
i've traveled the entire world 
and a thing i'm coming to say to you 
i traveled from Bahrein until Beirut 
i went from the north until the south pole 
and i didn't finds eyes like those 
like the ones you have
