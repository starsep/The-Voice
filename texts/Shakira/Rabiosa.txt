Shakira:
Rabiosa
If you don't get enough I'll make it double
I got my boy in big, big trouble
You know i want ya, atracao ahi.
Ratata
You got a lot of the sex appeal,
Don't play along because I'm for real.
You see that road isn't meant for me
You know I want you amarrao aqui

Oh ya papi, you're like a mocha,
Come get a little closer and bite me en la boca
Oh ya papi, you're like a mocha,
Come get a little closer and bite me en la boca.

Rabiosa

Come closer
Come pull me closer

Just say rabiosa

Come pull me closer.

Rabiosa, if you don't get enough I'll make it double
