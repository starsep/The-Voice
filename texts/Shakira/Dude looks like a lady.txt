Cruised into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced a grime on his door
She a long lost love at first sight
Baby, mabye you're wrong
But you know it's all right - that's right

Back stage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody says
'Forgive me if I seem out of line'
Then she whipped out a gun
Tried to blow me away

(Chorus)
Dude Looks Like A Lady
Dude Looks Like A Lady
Dude Looks Like A Lady
Dude Looks Like A Lady

So never judge a book by its cover
Or who you gonna love by your lover
Love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a venus
Lord, imagine my surprise

(Chorus)

(Baby let me follow you down)
Let me take a peak dear
(Baby let me follow you down)
Do me, do me, do me all night
(Baby let me follow you down)
Turn the other cheek dear
(Baby let me follow you down)
Do me, do me, do me, sue me

What a funky lady
Oh, she like it, like it, like it, like it
Oh, he was a lady

(Repeat Chorus)
