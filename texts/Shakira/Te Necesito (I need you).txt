It's the rain of everyday 
that has augemented it's level 
And music doesn't have the same 
effect that it once had. 
Maybe I've lived too much 
in too little and too short a time... 
I don't even know what language I speak... 
nor which candles I carry within 
this burial. 
I feel that I do longer have the strengths 
to leap and reach the sun... 
and the harder I try... 
I can't even hear my own voice. 
I don't know if I've lived then thousand days... 
or a day ten thousand times. 
And I add you to my story... 
wanting to change all losses 
for gains. 
Chorus: 
I need you, I need you my love... 
Wherever you are... 
I lack your warmth. 
I need you, I need you my love.. 
because you'er a part of me 
I need you here... 
because I don't know how to live without you.... 
I have yet to learn.... 

And I find myself lost, 
Like a needle in a haystack. 
Like shifting sands... 
I submerge myself.... 
in my lonliness. 
I don't know if I've lived 
Ten thousand days 
Or one day ten thousand times. 
And I add you to my story... 
wanting to change the losses 
to gains 
(Repeat Chorus)
