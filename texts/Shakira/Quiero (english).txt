I want 

To waste my life... 
devouring every one of your thoughts... 
every step. .....Your freckles to fade 
and every kiss and every embrace 
to be drawn in their place. 
And now that you are here 
I'm happy once again. 
I could understand what you were for me 
let me olve you, to the point 
that you whither with my sadness... 
Let every sky turn cloudy and let 
it rain until it puddles. 
Let me kiss you, to the point that you're without breath 
and let me embrace you with such a force 
that I crush your bones. 
And now you're here 
I'm happy once again 
I could understand what you were to me. 
Chorus: 
I want to stretch out, 
chase you, mock you, 
I want to love you night and day, 
I want to waste my life. 
I want to tie you to my 
sixty of waist (? ) 
Take you like a tattoo 
I want to lose my sheepish ways... (?)
