If You Stay With Me 

Let all the news channels go bankrupt 
I hate television so much anyway 
Let smiles become old fashion 
And let sunsets be no more 
Let all doctrines and duties disappear 
Let action movies be over and done 
Let worldly pleasures be wiped out 
And let one last song be written today 
Chorus 
But as long as I have you and your embrace 
And the kiss you invent each new day 
As long as your melancholy remains here with me 
Forever after the sunset 
Because I do depend on you 
As long as I have you 
I have life 
Let all the neighbors disappear 
And let them eat the leftovers of my innocence 
Let friends go away one by one 
And let them gnaw at my piece of concience 
Let words be in people's lips 
Let the planet's waters be polluted 
Or let philosophers and intellectuals give up 
And let the last poet die today 
Repeat Chorus
