You...You 
You are still a whisper on my lips 
I feel it at my fingertips 
Pulling at my skin 
You 
You leave when I'm at my worst 
A feeling as if I've been cursed 
Bitter cold within 

Days go by and still I think of you 
Days when I couldn't live my life without you 
Without You 
Without You 

You are still a whisper on my lips 
I feel it at my fingertips 
Pulling at my skin 
You leave me when I'm at my worst 
A feeling as if I've been cursed 
Bitter cold within 

Chorus(2x)
