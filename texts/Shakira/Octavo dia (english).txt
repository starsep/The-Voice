The eighth God points out so much work 
to free tensions already revising 
he said everything's fine and it's and hour of resting 
and he left for a walk in given space 
who will imagine that the same God upon returning 
will find everthing out of order 
and that one more will be unemployed 
at that rate annually growing without stopping 

for that then who has seen him 
alone in the streets and traffic 
he's waiting for somebody patient 
on ewho's calm 
and can converse 

while so much of this world rotates and rotates 
without being able to stop 
and here below some manage us as chess records 
i'm not the idiot's class 
that allowes you to convince, but i say the truth 
and until a blind man can see it 

if a lack of occupation 
or excessive solitude 
God didn't resist more 
and left to another place 
ti would be our perdition 
there would not be another remedy more 
to adore Michael Jackson 
Bill Clinton or Tarzan 

it's more difficult to be a king without a crown 
who is a more normal person 
poor God doesn't leave in the magazines 
that it's not a model nor an artist or a real family 

while so much of this world rotates and rotates 
without being able to stop 
and here below some manage us as chess records 
i'm not the idiot's class 
that allowes you to convince, but i say the truth 
and until a blind man can see it
