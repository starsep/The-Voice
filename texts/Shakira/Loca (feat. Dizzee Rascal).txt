Loca
Loca
Dance or die
Loca
Loca

She's playing dumb all the time
Just to keep it fun
To get you on like a ahh!
Be careful amigo
She talking and walking just to work you up
And she'd die for your love
But your love's only mine now

Yo sigo tranquila
Like I'm on a beach in Anguilla
Sipping my Corona
Like there's nothin' going on
I ain't leaving you alone
What is meant to me
No other girl is gonna take it
So give him up

And I'm crazy, but you like it 
Loca, loca, loca
And you like that it ain't easy 
Loca, loca, loca
And I'm crazy, but you like it 
Loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it

That girl is a nutter
Hot girl, I heat up when I touch her
Chica caliente got me bumpin' to merengue
I feel so el presidente
I'm runnin' shit and I'm lovin' it
She's got a mean ol' bumper you should
See what she does with it
She dips it down low (down low, down low)
I can never get enough (oh no, oh no)
She gives me the run around, but I stay chasing
But I need help, I'm in love with a crazy girl
But it's all good and it's fine by me
Just as long as I hear her say, "aye papi"

And I'm crazy, but you like it 
Loca, loca, loca
And you like that it ain't easy 
Loca, loca, loca
And I'm crazy, but you like it 
Loca, loca, loca
And I'm crazy, but you like it 
Loca, loca, loca

You're the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she's got it all
I got one kiki

You're the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she's got it all
I got my kiki

OK she doesn't know the things that I do to please you
I take you to the malecón por un caminito
They saw your girlfriend looking for me with a rifle
'Cause we were dancing mambo
Waht she don't allow?

[Dizzee Rascal]
I really can't help it if I make the lady loca
I don't want no trouble I just want to hit the ooh!

And I'm crazy, but you like it
'Cause a kind of girl like me
They are running out of in the market

And I'm crazy, but you like it 
Loca, loca, loca
And you like that it ain't easy 
Loca, loca, loca
And I'm crazy, but you like it 
Loca, loca, loca
And I'm crazy, but you like it 
Dios mío

That girl is a loca...
That girl is a loca...
That girl is a loca...
Madness, pure madness...
Loca...
That girl is a loca...
That girl is a loca...

You're the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she's got it all
I got my kiki

And I'm crazy, but you like it 
Loca, loca, loca
And you like that it ain't easy 
Loca, loca, loca
