Tell me what you'll do 
after you the first time her body needed 
When your frolicsome curiosity goes dead 
When you remember on all her intrigues 
and when you decide to come back 
then I won't be on the same place 
when her forehead not more then two fingers wide is 
and you find out that she don't clean her tooth enough 
and take your last money 
and leave you how she want 
I know, that you arrived on the same day 
on the day how she tear you 
withous kisses to cry 
but when you have decide 
and not more want with me 
is all unimportant, too 
because without you is the world all the same to me 

Chorus: 
When you go, when you go, when you go away from me 
will be my heaven grey 
when you go, when you go, you mustn't come back to me again 
when you go, when you go, 
and when you exchange for this whife 
this piece of skin, 
they come never back, because I won't be here 

every new broomis good sweeping 
but soon you will see the worn-out bristly 
when the fold go through her skin 
you'll come out of you hell 
with the tail between the hornes 
and amplore me again 
but when the time comes 
i'll be one million nights away from this big town 
one million night away from you 
is the world all the same to me 

Chorus repeat
