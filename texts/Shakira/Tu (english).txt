Ig ive you my waist 
and my lips for when you want to kiss 
i give you my madness 
and the few neurons that already remain 
my faded shoes 
the newspaper that i write 
until i give all my sighs 
but don't leave anymore 

because you are my sun 
the faith that i live with 
the power of my voice 
the feet that i walk with 
you are my love 
my desires of laughing 
the goodbye that i won't know how to say 
because i won't be able to live without you 

if one day you decide 
to leave again from here 
i would close each door 
so that you can't ever leave 

i give you my silences 
i give you nose 
until i give you my bones 
but stay here 

because you are my sun 
the faith that i live with 
the power of my voice 
the feet that i walk with 
you are my love 
my desires of laughing 
the goodbye that i won't know how to say 
because i won't be able to live without you
