Just a little bit more love 
Just a little bit more passion 
This is How it should begin, skin on skin 
If you leave ne nom telling me 
You failed somehow 
Better think it all over 
Just as long as love´s around 
Here´s a true romanye 
Be aware and take your chance 
Tomorrow I´m gonna leave you 
But I am here for you night 

Chorus: 
Just a little bit more love 
Just a little bit more passion 
This is how it should begin, skin on skin 
Juste a little getting close 
Just a little bit more affaction 
´Cause I don´t think it´s a sin 
Skin on Skin 

So we better get it on 
What is here will soon begone 
When the leaves are falling 
Maybe we could fall apart 
And there may come a time 
When you will forget my love is true 
So Baby let me show you what to do 

Chorus: 
.... 

Don´t you know that this game is play 
Just as long as it´s time 
Can´t you see 
That my heart´s gotta know 
When you´re gonna be mine ? 

Chorus: 

Don´t you know that this game is play? 
Don´t you know don´t you know that it´s time? 
Can´t you see 
That my heart´s gotta know 
When you´re gonna be mine? 
Just a little bit more love 
Just a little bit more love 
Just a little bit more love 
Just a little bit more love 
Just a little bit more passion 
Skin on Skin
