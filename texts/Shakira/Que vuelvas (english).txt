And what am i going to do with my selective lack of care 
and what with my frustrated dream of learning to cook 
and what i'm going to do with sundays 
and holidays, no plan is appropriate 
when i try not to think 
perhaps it will tell me where you go 
now that i'm not 
tell me where to go 
now that you aren't 
what will i invent to tell the entire world 
if they see me fallen to the ground 
without more desire to fly 
how do i hide this pair of broken wings 
and the soles of my boots 
tired of walking 
perhaps it will tell me where you go 
now that i'm not 
tell me where to go 
now that you aren't 
chorus: 

i want you to return 
that you are claiming 
my lips you haven't kissed in a long time 
i want you to come back 
already you see that even my hands 
from not touching you so much, they ache, they ache 
and what am i going to do if my chin hits the floor 
and although i tried my smile doesn't leave naturally 
if they have already seen with the lost glance 
a few pounds less 
and some tears of more 
perhaps it will tell me where you go 
now that i'm not 
tell me where to go 
now that you aren't 

chorus: 

i want you to return 
that you are claiming 
my lips you haven't kissed in a long time 
i want you to come back 
if you knew taht you were for me 
and always wanted to be here 
i still don't understand how, when, where 
or why i lost you, i don't know how to live like this
