I'm going to leave 
that my guitar says all what i 
don't know how to say for me 
or maybe it should wait 
to the insult of the clock 
i have just planned my end 
the smiles hurt so much 
it costs the world to breathe 
it's that not having you here makes me bad 

it follows me around 
the shadow of you 
they keep rotating around there 
all the words that we said 
and the kisses we didn't give 
as always 
today i am 
thinking of you 

you should know 
that there are pieces of your mouth unintentionally 
wanted around here 
and that i trip everyday without thinking 
with an old memory more 
and some new gray history 
if i can't be with you 
i can no long be with you 
every time it becomes harder to be happy 

it follows me around 
the shadow of you 
they keep rotatins around there 
all the words that we said 
and the kisses we didn't give 
as always 
today i am 
thinking of you 

all the words that we said 
and the kisses we didn't give 
as always 
today i am 
thinking of you
