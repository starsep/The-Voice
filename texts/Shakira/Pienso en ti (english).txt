I think Of You 

Everyday, I think of you. 
I think a bit more of you 
I take apart my heart... 
Something in me is destroyed... 
Everyday I think of you. 
I think a bit more of you... 
Everytime that the sun comes out 
I look for a bit of valor 
to continue. 
And I see you, I didn't touch you that way. 
I pray for you every night... 
Itd awns and I think of you. 
And it rumbles in my ears 
the tick-tock of the clocks 
and I keep thinking of you 
and I keep thinking.....
