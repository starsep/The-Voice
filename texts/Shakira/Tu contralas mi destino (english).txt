When I think that this 
Can be solved 
You get close to me and throw everything out the window 
And fear has made me much stronger than you 
But you're just going to conquer me anyways 
But now I realize 
That my heart races and I shake 

My feelings revolt me 
My heart stops 
I can't bear that you control my destiny 

Chorus: 
Have a little bit of mercy on me 
You don't see that I'm on the point of giving up 
I find myself paralyzed from head to toe 
And I don't know what to do 

And now I tell myself 
To forget about the fear 
Because my love inside is burning like a wildfire 
And the fear that burns me up 
Comes back and invades my land 
So that things don't work like I want 
But that feeling is stronger 
Than my thoughts. 

My feelings revolt me 
My heart stops 
I can't bear that you control my destiny 

Have a little mercy on me...
