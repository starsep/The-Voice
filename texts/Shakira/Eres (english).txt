You're sensational 
A crazy perso nfull of strange ideas 
Very original 
You're sentimental 
Also transparent 
But so different 
From everyone else I know. 

Equally I recognize 
When I'm without you 
I feel dead 
Incomplete 
You fulfill me 
Because you're my prison 
And sweet warden. 

Chorus: 
What is it that makes you 
So special 
You paralyze my soul 
Just by talking 
What is it about your eyes 
They make me melt 
And I like you a lot 
Your style of loving 
What makes you be 
So dreamy. 

You say what you think 
Without any fear 
You are a calm breeze 
You are fire and emotion 
I saw your darkness 
And I felt warmth 

Your aggressiveness 
And my savage soul 
That seeks to intimidate me 
Heartless poet 
Confused bohemian 
Have been for me 
My space and my time 
My best invention 
Because you taught me 
The sweet emotion 
Of love 

What is it that makes you 
So special...
