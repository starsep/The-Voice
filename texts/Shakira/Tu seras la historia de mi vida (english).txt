In my diary 
In its pages 
I'm looking for a life experience 
And your strength always guides me. 
You healed my wounds 
And the pressure of your love 
Makes me feel important. 

My soul 
No one knows it as well as you 
My life 
I see it in you. 

Chorus: 
Well, you will be my story 
You guided me in darkness 
And you will always be at my side when I call 
When I call 
I want to love you and give you more 
And if I were to write a book 
You would definitely be in it. 

That's my story 
That you will be my story 
I don't think about tomorrow 
Even in happiness or sadness 
I'll look for where you are 
Well, I'm lost without your love 
And I will be your faithful friend 
As the air that you breathe 
I will heal your heart. 

Well, you will be my story...
