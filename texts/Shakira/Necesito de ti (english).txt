Racing pulse, your head is going to burst 
And your heart is bleeding 
You're crazy, you can't even breathe 
You're tired of being alone with your loneliness. 

You break open the wound in your soul 
It's obvious at a glance 
You need someone who loves you passionately 
Covers you with illusion, opens your heart. 

Chorus: 
You have need of me,o f me 
I have need of you, of you 
You need love, my love oh come here... 
You have a need of me, of me 
I have a need of you, of you 
You need love, my love oh come here... 

I'm lost in the desert 
Missing you to death 
I feel like I can't breathe if you aren't here 
Nothing makes me happy 
I'm not going to resist it. 

I can't manage anything if you aren't next to me 
My television and my friends 
Each party makes me more and more bored 
I don't know how to study anymore, I can't concentrate 

Chorus (repeat)
