Magic, I feel magic 
Since some time ago something new is being born in me 
Magic, I feel magic 
When you speak to me I tremble all over, that's the way it is 

I walk around absentmindedly 
I don't listen to what they say 
I only think about 
Your being near me 

Chorus: 
Magic, your look, 
Like the moon, makes me tremble to my toes 
Magic, I feel magic 
If I'm with you in the desert I'm happy 

They say that I even see ghosts 
Or that I have problems 
And the reason is that 
I'd love you until death. 

And this is how it is, already I can't even sleep 
I pass the day thinking about you 
I live in a trance and it's because of you 
And it's like this, I only live for you 
I don't know how to study nor go out 
I don't know what spell you've cast on me 

horus 
And this is how it is, I still can't even sleep 
I pass the day thinking about you 
I live bewitched and it's because of you 
It's like this, I only live for you 
I don't know how to study nor go out 
I don't know what spell you've cast on me. 
And that's the way it is...
