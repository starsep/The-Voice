Don’t heal the fundamental must
Still watch your own little ass
But you should know
I love you so
For you, I'll take a chance

To forgive is an art
And it’s a pain knowing how to last
No, don't you play with my heart
Don't leave me here,
Just take me home, safe and fast

No one can see it now
Can't you believe in how
There is no wrong
There is no right
It's you and I together
