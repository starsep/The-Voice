You thought that I felt lucky with my humble breasts,
well I don't.
said that I was sure the world was gonna change
well I'm not.
Thought I didn't give damn 'bout what they say,
But I do.
I promised that I'd never ever lie to you.

So you can help,
taking the make-up of my face,
before I forget my own features.
I'm not here to let you down,
But the costume makes the clown.
It's just life's so not on me don't be so hard, don't be so hard on this.
It's your turn now,
to cheat on me.

Promises I made to you went down the sink.
I really hope I haven't harmed your selfasteem.
I'm not a virgin but I'm not the whore you think.
And I don't always smell like strawberries and cream.

So you can help,
taking the make-up of my face,
before I forget who I am now.
Cuz I'm not here to let you down,
But the costume makes the clown.
It's just life's so not on me don't be so hard, don't be so hard on this.
It's your turn now.
Your turn now.

I'm not here to let you down,
But the costume makes the clown.
It's just life's so not on me don't be so hard, don't be so hard on this.
It's your turn now, your turn now.
To cheat on me.
