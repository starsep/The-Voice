I love to lie out in the sun 
Hair down with suntan lotion 
With my yellow Walkman 
Towel, sand in my ear 
When you pass by 
I feel shocked that you didn't 
Smile at me. 
I become distracted 
Betraying my heart 
And I put on jeans 
And I run 
Don't follow me, please 
I don't know how.... 
In your eyes 
Of quicksand 
I feel everything 
And here inside the slack rope 
I feel scared. 
I don't know how anyone can be so beautiful 
So interesting, a thunderclap 
In my heavens 
And I feel fear 
That this is your love 
Danger, danger 
I love my collection 
the magazines 
And the jokes that don't explain 
They distract my attention 
Please, enough already 
Stop, stop, stop 
If we cut it off, it's would be best 
Leave me alone with my life 
Who said that in my movie 
You would be the leading part 
And I even carry you around in my pockets 
I believe that I will go crazy.
