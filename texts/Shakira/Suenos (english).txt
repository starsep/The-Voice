I always dreamed wtih the stars 
And rode to them on my bicycle 
I always dreamed of being a sea princess 
Talking with seaweed and whales. 
It was my life, my fantasy 
Not just a dream 
What I didn't know was that you existed 
Or that you were my only salvation. 

Chorus: 
Because I can't breathe if you aren't here 
I can't get used to 
When you talk to me, nothing can compare 
I already know it, you aren't perfect and it's the truth 
But you'll always be here inside of me 
You make my fantasies reality 

Castles, princesses, what irony 
Fantasies after all 
My Prince Charming, my poetry 
Was not far from my life. 
I had a feeling that you'd come 
That I would love you until the end 
I had a world of illusions 
In which I saved a spot for you 

Chorus (repeat)
