Imagine, I can just imagine 
That I've stopped seeing myself as a little girl 
That you will call, and today you will invite me out to dinner 
later to dance under the moon. 
But a thousand of these dreams do not become reality 
An abyss in which I arrive 
I know that I'm very far away. 

Imagine, I can just imagine 
That you have made me your princess 
And once again, I will feel how I become a sea 
Covering you with sand. 
But so much that I think you will not look at me 
Today I find myself so lost 
Because I'm so far away. 

Chorus 
Far from your love, far from your heart 
Far from your love and without a way out of it, 
Far from your love, far from your heart 
Far from your love and without a way out of it, come back please 

Imagine, I can just imagine 
That I've stopped seeing myself as a little girl 
That you will call, and today will you invite me out to dinner 
Later to dance under the moon. 
But a thousand of these dreams do not become reality 
An abyss in which I arrive 
I know that I'm very far away. 

Chorus (repeat)
