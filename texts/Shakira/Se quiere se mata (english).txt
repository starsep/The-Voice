It's Wanted, It's Killed 

Braulio has large eyes and dark hair, 
he never overeats and has never selpt nude 
he always dresses in grey, no remedy for it. 
The tendecy of looking for oneself is always at an intermediate point. 
Dana is a good girl, that's what her parents say 
She never arrives at home before ten...nor too late, 
Braulioand Dana care for each other...liek any normal couple.. 
But they hurried nature's course. 
And from their own instincts... 
they didn't escape with luck... 
..with the fire within 
and hormones present... 
By the law of megnetism 
they joined bodies. 
Chorus: 
But if around tea time nothing happens, 
oh oh oh 
You'll only go far from home 
oh oh oh 
For having brought another inhabitant 
to join this rotted city 
where something isn't wanted, it's killed....it's killed 

That day you arrived a bit later than ten 
But the scare didn't coem 'til a few day slater 
when those terrible suspicions were confirmed 
a child would be born and you already knew the date 
And before the neighbor or the parents were to find out.... 
You went to the doctor to do away with the problem. 
Today your neighbor is at home taking a shower 
And you...two meters undeground watching worms grow 
(Repeat Chorus)
