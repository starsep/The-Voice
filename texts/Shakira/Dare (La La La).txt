Hola! Hola!

La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

I dare you
Leggo
leggo
leggo
leggo

All of my life
Too late
'Til you showed up with perfect timing
Now here we are
We rock it
Our fingers are stuck in the socket

It's just the nature - a game
Get ready we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober

Is it true that you love me
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor...
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la 
La la la la la

Oh oh oh oh

I dare you
Leggo
leggo

Of all the millions on the planet
You're the one
Who's keeping me on it
You know I like you like nobody's business
Your blue Spanish eyes are my witness

It's just the nature - a game
Get ready we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober

Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
I dare you to touch me
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La la la la la
La la la la la 
La la la la la 
La la la la la
I dare you
