Forgive us our traspasses
As we forgive those who have traspassed againts us
Give us our daily bread, daily bread, daily bread

In cell et in terra voluntuas tua
Gloria Spiritui Sancto

What languaje do you speak, if you speak at all?
Are you some kind of freak, who lives to rise the ones who fall?
Hey could you tell me why the cat fights the dog?
Do you go to the mosque or the synagoge?

And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
And if you wrote the script, then why the trouble makers?

CHORUS:
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high?
And are you happy? Do you ever cry?
You've made mistakes, well that's ok 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours, Will you forgive mine?

Hey do you feel our pain
And walk in our shoes?
Have you ever felt starved?
Or is your belly always full?
How many people die and hurt in your name?
Hey does that make you proud, or does it bring you shame?

And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
And if you wrote the script, then why the trouble makers?

CHORUS:
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high?
And are you happy? Do you ever cry?
You've made mistakes, well that's ok 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours, Will you forgive mine?

Forgive us our traspasses
As we forgive those who have traspassed againts us
Give us our daily bread, daily bread, daily bread

CHORUS:
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high?
And are you happy? Do you ever cry?
You've made mistakes, well that's ok 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours, Will you forgive mine?

CHORUS:
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high?
