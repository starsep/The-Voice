Flies in the house 

my days without you are so dark, 
so long, so gray, 
my days without you are so absurd, 
so bitter, so tough, 
my days without you, 
my days without you don't have nights, 
if someone appears, 
it's useless to sleep, 
my days without you are an excess, 
the hours don't have a beginning, or end 
so short of air, 
so filled with nothing, 
useless junk, 
trash on the floor, 
flies in the house 

my days without you are like a sky, 
without silvery moons, 
nor traces of the sun, 
my days without you are only an echo, 
that always repeats, 
the same song 

so short of air, 
so filled with nothing, 
useless junk, 
trash on the floor, 
flies in the house 

stumble on the rocks, 
still i keep waiting that you'll return to me, 
still i keep looking in the faces of the old, 
bits of a child, 
hunting reasons that make me believe, 
that still i meet with life, 
biting my fingernails, 
drowing in my tears, 
missing you so much, 

my days without, 
oh how they hurt, my days without you
