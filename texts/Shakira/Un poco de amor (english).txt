Today is one of those days 
In which I look towards the sky 
Trying to decipher that you are 
Once in a while far 
And once in a while near 
Sometimes coming up 
And others coming down, and I, 
When you get close to me 
Am not responsible for my actions 
I feel like, here I go, 
From hating you to loving you, 
From beginning to end, 
Searching for a little bit of love... 

There are things in life 
That you don't find a way out of 
And before your eyes the curtain is drawn 
And you plug the mouth of the volcano 
That becomes lava that has been 
A thousand years here inside, and I, 
Knitting hairnets to see if I 
Can capture you, and here I go, 
Straining off the putty 
In the middle of this deadly tropic 
Searching for a little bit of love...
