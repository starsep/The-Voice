Stay, baby, stay, baby
Neaver leave again
Stay, baby, stay, baby
Never leave again

A machine
Designed to think of you
That is what i am
What i always was

You know this cruel wait is killing me
Resignation is a desire without skin
Everyday something cries inside of me
There's no logical way to build my life without you

And although i make myself appear invincible
What is fatal, what is essential
Is that you come back t me, come back to me, come back
The pain is suffocating
And what's important now
Is that you come back to me, come back to me, come back
Don't torture me like this

A machine
Of living without peace
That is what i am
Since you've been gone

You say there's no sense in reacting like this
You've made your choice
That i should live and let live
But i don't want to break the ties that bind me to you
Have some consideration and don't leave me suffering

And although i make myself appear invincible
What is fatal, what is essential
Is that you come back t me, come back to me, come back
The pain is suffocating
And what's important now
Is that you come back to me, come back to me, come back
Don't torture me like this

Come back, just come back
Come back and never leave again

Come back, just come back
Come back and never leave again

And although i make myself appear invincible
What is fatal, what is essential
Is that you come back t me, come back to me, come back
The pain is suffocating
And what's important now
Is that you come back to me, come back to me, come back
Don't torture me like this
