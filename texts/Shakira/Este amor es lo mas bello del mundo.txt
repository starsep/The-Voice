Starting to love 
Discovering this truth 
That I just met you 
And already there's nothing more for me 
To think or feel. 
That you are my end 
Sweet image that came out in a video 
Believe me that I love you 
That in my eyes you're a VIP 
The tenderness in the mirror 
That smiles back at me happily 

Chorus: 
Because I know that this love is the most beautiful in the world 
It uncovered my heart 
To love you each second 
Because I know that this love that is as much mine as yours 
Is not passion without love 
Trapeze artist without a net 
Between both of us, between both of us 

The warmth of the sun 
I sing this song for you 
Because it tells you that you hvae... 
The pain left from your sky once 
If you tell me you love me I feel wonderful 
You see me in class 
Or in front of the television 
Repeating your name 
Or writing it to you in a...
