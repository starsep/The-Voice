I'll Wait for You, Sitting 

I'll wait for you,sitting 
on the corner liek always, 
And a bit more dressed up than if 
it were a Friday 
without a date previously made. 
But with the plain intuition of seeing you, 
My eyes don't stop looking and looking 
at the dark stone 
of Ideas. 
Looking for more hollows, 
within this hollow . 
Looking for a light 
in the middle of this sky. 
I tuck away my hands 
because I'm cold. 
and they feel odd 
inside my pockets. 
Over an hour and a half has passed, 
and you still haven't shown, 
My intinct has failed me... 
It known not of loves, 
but it's just that my instinct 
doesn't know of...... 
Chorus: 
Living live without you... 
is something like dying, 
is walking without looking where you're going, 
is singing without hearing, 
is speaking without breathing, 
eating without digesting. 
Because I discovered.. 
that you're the perfect form... 
the perfect size... 
just for me and it's like this.... 

(Repeat Chorus)
