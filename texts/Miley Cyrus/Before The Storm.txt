[featuring Jonas Brothers] 


Nick: 
Yeaaaaah 

Miley: 
Whoaaaaa 

Miley: 
I know this isnt what I wanted 
never thought it'd come this far 
just thinking back to where we started 
and how we lost all that we are 

Nick: 
we were young and times were easy 
but i could see it's not the same 
i'm standing here but you don't see me 
i'd give it all for that to change 
and i dont want to lose her 
i dont want to let her go 

Chorus: 
Miley: 
Im standing out in the rain 
i need to know if its over 
cause I will leave you alone 

Nick: 
flooded with all this pain 
knowing that i'll never hold her 
like i did before the storm 

Nick: 
Yeaaaaah 

Miley: 
before the storm 

Nick: 
and with every strike of lightning 

Miley: 
comes a memory that lasts 

Niley: 
not a word is left unspoken as the thunder starts to crash 

Miley: 
maybe i should give up 

Chorus: 
Miley: 
Im standing out in the rain 
i need to know if its over 
cause I will leave you alone 

Nick: 
flooded with all this pain 
knowing that i'll never hold her 
like i did before the storm 

Miley: 
trying to keep the light from going in 

Niley: 
and the clouds from ripping out my broken heart 
We always say a heart is not whole without the one who gets you through the storm 

Chorus: 
Niley: 
Standing out in the rain 
knowing that it's really over â€“ 
please don't leave me alone 

Flooded with all this pain 
knowing that i'll never hold you 
like I did before the storm 
like i did before the storm
