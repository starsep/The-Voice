Don't call me, leave me alone
Not gonna answer my phone
Cause I don't
No, I won't
See you

I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
'Cause I don't
And I won't
Need you

Time to dial 911
We gonna have some fun
Hey boy, you know you better run!

'Cause it's a girl's night
It's alright
Without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out
Without you
You'd better hold tight
It's girl's night
Without you

Let's go, G.N.O
Let's go, G.N.O
Let's go, G.N.O
Let's go
it's a girl's night

I'll dance with somebody new
Wont have to think about you
And who knows what that will lead to
You'll here from everyone
You'll get the 411
Hey boy you knew this day would come

Cause it's a girl's night
It's alright
Without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out
Without you

Let's go, G.N.O
Let's go, G.N.O
Let's go, G.N.O
Let's go

Hey boy, Don't you wish you could had been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me boy.
Feel me when I tell you I'm fine
and it's time for me to draw the line 2x

Cause it's a girl's night
It's alright
Without you
I'm gonna stay out
and play out
Without you
You'd better hold tight
It's a girl's night
Without you

Let's go, G.N.O
Let's go, G.N.O
Let's go, G.N.O
Let's gooo
It's a girl's night
