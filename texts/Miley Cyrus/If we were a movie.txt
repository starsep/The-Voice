Uh oh, There you go again talkin' cinematic
Yeah you, You're charming, got everybody star struck.
I know, How you always seem to go
For the obvious
instead of me
But get a ticket and you'll see

If we were a movie
You'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with In the end
we'd be laughing
Watching the sunset
Fade to black
Show the names
Play the happy song

Yeah, yeah, When you call me I can hear it in your voice
Oh sure, Wanna see me And tell me all about her
La la, I'll be acting through my tears
I Guess you'll never know
That I should win
An Oscar for this scene I'm in

If we were a movie
You'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with In the end
we'd be laughing
Watching the sunset
Fade to black
Show the names
Play the happy song

Wish I could tell you there's a twist
Some kind of hero in disguise
And we're together It's for real, Now playing
Wish I could tell you there's a kiss
Like something more than in my mind I see it
Could be amazing

If we were a movie
You'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with In the end
we'd be laughing
Watching the sunset
Fade to black
Show the names
Play the happy song X 3
