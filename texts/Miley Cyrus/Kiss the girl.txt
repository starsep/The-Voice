(feat. Ashley Tisdale)

[Ahhh, kiss the girl.Ahhh, kiss the girl]

There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl

Yes, you want her
Look at her you know you do
Possible she wants you too
There's one way to ask her
You don't say a word
Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl

Chorus
Sha la la la la la, my oh my
Looks like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la, ain't that sad?
Isn't the shame?
Too bad, you gonna miss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl [kiss the girl]

Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, it's better to do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl

Chorus
Sha la la la la la, my oh my
Looks like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la, ain't that sad?
Isn't the shame?
Too bad, you gonna miss the girl
Sha la la la la la, don't be scared
You've got be prepared
Go on and kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la, don't stop now
Don't try to hide it now

You wanna kiss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl
Kiss the girl

[Ahhh, kiss the girl.Ahhh, kiss the girl]
la la la la, la la la la
Go on and kiss the girl
la la la la, la la la la
Go on and kiss the girl

Sha la la la la la, my oh my
Looks like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la, ain't that sad?
