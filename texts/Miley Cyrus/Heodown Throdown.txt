1! 2! 3! Everybody
C'mon off your seats!
I'm gonna tell you 'bout a beat
That's gonna make you move your feet.

Ill Give The Barbecue,
Show and Tell You How To Move
If you're 5 or 82
This is somethin' you can do!

Pop it, Lock it,
Polka do it
Countrify it and hip hop it.
Put your hawk in the sky
move Side to side
Jump to the left
Stick it, glide.
Zig zag cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits,
Hands on your hips
One foot is, 180 twist
And then a, zig zag,
Step, slide
Lean it left,
Clap three times
Shake it out
Head to toe
Throw it all together
That's how we roll

Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Throw it all together
That's how we roll

We get to 4, 5, 6
And you're feelin' busted
But it's not time to quit
Practice makes you perfect

Pop it, Lock it,
Polka do it
Countrify it and hip hop it.
Put your hawk in the sky
move Side to side
Jump to the left
Stick it, glide.
Zig zag cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits,
Hands on your hips
One foot is, 180 twist
And then a, zig zag,
Step, slide
Lean it left,
Clap three times
Shake it out
Head to toe
Throw it all together
That's how we roll

Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Throw it all together
That's how we roll
