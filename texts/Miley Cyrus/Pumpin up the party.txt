Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin up the party now

It's the same old saying
That we don't give a waste in time
Another way
Not so sure that we can find
My friend, my time
No one gets left behind
If they did it'd be a drag
That's why we say
Let the music start a revolution
Its time that we say

Hey

Hey

They get we get
Parents might not understand
How to come with out them, but that's what we do
Were all here

Let's go!
Gotta make this party go.
Up to the roof
The music?s gonna start a revolution
Together we can make it flow
Its time that we say

Hey
Get up
Get loud 
Start pumpin up the party now
Hey

We don't have to play by numbers
Let our voice come out from under
Her we our come here the thunder
It's time to lose control!
