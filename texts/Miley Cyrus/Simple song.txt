Wake up here i go , cram it all down my throat
Stomach so full that I wish I could choke
seven am my heads already in a spin
as soon as I'm out that door 
Bam hits me like a ton of those red bricks 
Can't dig myself out of this highest ditch 
This madness

I swear sometimes I can't tell 
Which way is up, which way is down
It's all up in my face, need to push it away 
Some body push it away, so all that i can hear
Is a simple song
Sing along now

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

Mid day, sun beat on the concrete 
Burnin up my feet 
Too many cars on the street
The noise, the red, the green 
makes me wanna scream
5 oclock knocks, bumper on bumper on bumper 
Horns honking, nobody's looking 
But everybody's talking
It's another day
On this Highway

I swear sometimes I can't tell 
Which way is up, which way is down
It's all up in my face, need to push it away 
Some body push it away, cuz all that i wanna hear
It's a simple song
Sing along now

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la 
Hey!

Sing along now
Sing along

What I'd give to turn it off
To make it stop, make it stop
You gotta make it stop
So all that I can hear
Is a simple song
Sing along now

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
