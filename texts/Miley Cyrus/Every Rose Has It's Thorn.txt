We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Yeah I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does

I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could let you know somehow

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar will remain

Every rose, every rose, every rose has its thorn

I know I could saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

And now hear you found somebody new
And that never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Every rose has its thorn
(Every rose, every rose, every rose)
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
