You tucked Me in turn Out the light
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little Girls depend on things like that
Brushed my teeth and comp my hair
Had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back

You had to do it all alone
Make a live and make a home
Must have been as hard as it could be
And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me

Caterpillar in the tree
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far but you can always dream
Wish you may and wish you might
Don't you worry , hold on tight
I promise you there will come a day
Butterfly Fly Away

Butterfly Fly Away (Butterfly fly away)
Flap your wings now you can't stay
Take those dreams and make them all come true
Butterfly Fly Away (Butterfly fly away)
You been waiting for this day
All along and know what just to do

Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
Butterfly fly away

Butterfly fly away
(Butterfly fly away)

Butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away
