After 12, not so well
Won't the bright Len's Sensors tell?
What's round this bend?
No dosgrace about this
Only thing I dare is to chase you down again
You know nothing hurts like loosing
When you know what's really gone
Except all the blame and the choosing
You want to long

[Chorus:]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
And the credit's starting to roll

[Verse 2:]
A lot to say
About today
Let the radio break the silence
As we drive
A kiss goodbye
Not this time
Don't remember about this song
I ever liked
You know nothing hurts like loosing
When you know it's already gone
Except all the pain and the choosing
You want to long

[Chorus:]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
And the credit's starting to roll

[Bridge:]
I thought I knew everything about me
But I know nothing at all
I watch your tail lights fading
I tried it to them all
I remember what it feels like to know love
And have it taken away
If you wanna learn right now
You'll be thanking me someday

[Chorus:]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
And the credit's starting to roll
