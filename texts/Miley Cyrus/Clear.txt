It's 6 am and I'm wide awake
Cuz I can't stop thinking bout the stuff you were sayin'
Me and I, I can't let it slide
The papers not here yet
The sun's not up
But I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel inside
I had one of those dreams that made it all so

Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how long you tried to make me blame you
It was me who was bein' the fake
So clear

Why did I smile when I hurt inside
Said I was okay when I knew it's a lie
I wanted to believe in you
You took your chances
And one was me
So I'll just forgive you
And set you free
I'm on my way
Yeah I'm steppin' out of the haze
And it's so

Clear to me now

I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how long you tried to make me blame you
It was me who was bein the fake
So clear

I wanna put the past behind
Try and maybe I can find better days
The first time in a while
I think I even feel the smile
On my face

oh oh oh oh
I got a whole new perspective (I do)
It's so clear
You can't treat me that way
It's so

Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how long you tried to make me blame you
It was me who was bein the fake
So clear
So clear
So clear

Suns going down on a Saturday
And I feel alright
I feel okay
