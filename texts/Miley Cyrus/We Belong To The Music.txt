Put Yo' hands out

I'm gonna put on my dancing shoes 
And find a crazy outfit 
'cause tonight it's all about you 
I can't wait to show you all my new moves 
I got a brand new 2 step 
You gonna like this outfit 
I got y'all right here 
no need for you to go anywhere 
turn it up until you can't rock anymore 
Mr DJ - look at what you made me do out on the floor 
That's what we say 

(Chorus) 
Hey, Hey 
We belong to the music 
We don't answer to you 
Hey, Hey 
That's right we ain't moving

It's a party we can dance if we want to 
C'mon and party like it ain't no curfew 
Hey, Hey

Gonna have a good time
