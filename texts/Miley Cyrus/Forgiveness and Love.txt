Imagining you're far away
Searching for the words to say
I feel it when you fall apart
our lives are our greatest art
I don't wanna change you mind
Cuz I accept you for everything you are
and well be
Stay here with me now

The only thing that our hearts are made of
are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real when push comes to shove
are the acts of forgiveness and love

Cuz in the end no one losses or wins
The stories begin, again and again
With forgiveness and love

You don't ever have to read my mind
You can see it when you close your eyes

Don't believe it when you lose your faith
Another moment is a moment of wait

I can't tell you what the futures holds, or how to live
All I know is what these bright lights of my life again and again

The only thing that our hearts are made of
are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real when push comes to shove
are the acts of forgiveness and love

Cuz in the end no one losses or wins
The stories begin, again and again
With forgiveness and love

Let's chop the Sun, let's find Forever
Where does the Time go?
Just live your life you get another
today is today is today Forgiveness and Love

Cuz in the end no one losses or wins
The stories begin, again and again
With forgiveness and love

Hmm..

Let's chop the Sun
Let's chop the Sun
Let's chop the Sun
