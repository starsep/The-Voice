Here's to all the ones tyring to hold you back
Trying to make you feel like you're less than that
Givin' nothin' more better than to make you crack
But really just try to put your dreams ,ontrack
And you know in the end it'll be okay
Cause allit really matters are the steps you take
And every thing else falls in the place

All right yeah,yeah

Free yourselves out the dark
Not a prisoner anymore

Don't be afraid to make a move 
It won't hurt you just do what you were born to do
