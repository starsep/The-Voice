Good morning midnight hello again
If I don't close my eyes please never end
Tick tick tock tock who's keeping time?
Throw away the stopwatch losing my mind
I'm so fixed on this high that I found
Once you touch the sky there is no coming down
Seconds turn to minutes
And the minutes turn to hours
And the hours turn to days
And the world goes round and round(15x)

The restless you're in my head
I cannot get you out
Hot on my lips taste of your kiss
I just can't live without
The restlessness (8x)

Good morning sunshine you strike a match
And until the twilight brighten the black
Wide awake but sometimes it seems
Like I'm running backwards lost in a dream

I'm so fixed on this high that I found
Once you touch the sky there is no coming down
Seconds turn to minutes
And the minutes turn to hours
And the hours turn to days
And the world goes round and round(15x)

The restlessness you're in my head
I cannot get you out
Hot on my lips taste of your kiss
I just can't live without
The restlessness (8x)

The seconds turn to minutes
And the minutes turn to hours
And the hours turn to days
And the world goes round and round(8x)

The restlessness you're in my head
I cannot get you out
Hot on my lips taste of your kiss
I just can't live without
The restlessness (4x)

The seconds turn to minutes
And the minutes turn to hours
And the hours turn to days
And the world goes round and round(4x)

The seconds turn to minutes
And the minutes turn to hours
And the hours turn to days
And the world goes round and round(4x)
