When the darkness leaves you lonely
Or the world tries to push you away
When your sky is looking troubled
You can count on me, 'cause I'm gonna stay
Put your worries in my pocket
I've got a key so we can lock it
I swear that I won't let them escape

Love - it's always worth it 
Love - everyone deserves it 
It's the friend that holds your hand 
When nobody understands 
Love - it wants to heal you 
Love - and see the real you 
But you have to open up 
When you need a little love

Na na na 
Na na na yeah 
Na na na 
Na na na yeah 
Na na na oh

If there's something you're in need of 
You only have to let me know 
I've got a shoulder you can lean on 
And I'm always right up the road 
Put your fears in my pocket 
I've got a key so we can lock it 
You know I won't let them escape

Love - it's always worth it 
Love - everyone deserves it 
It's the friend that holds your hand 
When nobody understands 
Love - it wants to heal you 
Love - and see the real you 
But you have to open up 
When you need a little love

Every night when your heart 
Is praying for peace 
From the noise in your head 
There's a light that is yours to keep 
That's brighter than all the rest

Love - it's always worth it 
Love - everyone deserves it 
It's the friend that holds your hand 
When nobody understands 
Love - it wants to heal you 
Love - and see the real you 
But you have to open up 
When you need a little love

Na na na 
Na na na yeah 
Na na na 
Na na na
When you need a little love 
Need a little love 
Oh oh yeah yeah 
Need a little love
