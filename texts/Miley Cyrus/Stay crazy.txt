Anything is easy for me 
Anything turns to me 
Not even back and talk 
Why am I here 

Chorus: 
Stay Crazy, is not new to me 
Stay Crazy, it is folly 
And I will leave here 
Stay Crazy, surprise me 
Stay Crazy, takes advantage of me 
And I will not sleep in peace 
Stay Crazy 

Everything happens suddenly for me 
I want great popularity 
But I will not change 
My way to be 
Why am that girl careful 
Uououai 

Chorus: 
Stay Crazy, is not new to me 
Stay Crazy, it is folly 
And I will leave here 
Stay Crazy, surprise me 
Stay Crazy, takes advantage of me 
And I will not sleep in peace 
Stay Crazy 

If suddenly I will send 
I will not sweating 
Only I sweating 

Yeah 

Stay Crazy 
Stay Crazy 
Stay Crazy
