See your face when I look in your eyes,
What you feel is no surprise,
someone needs something to believe in,
Tell me your dreams , I’ll tell you mine,
In our hearts, we’ll look inside,
And we’ll see all colors of rainbow,
I know!

[Chorus]
We all want to believe in love,
We all want to believe in something,
Bigger than just us,
We all want to be a part,
Of a greater picture,
Singing in our heart,
Yeah bigger than just us!

I want to see beyond my own world,
Grab your hands so we can twirl around the galaxy,
see the world with gravity,
Oh-oo-oh,
We ask for the long way to go,
But I know,
We’re getting closer everyday,
Everyday!

[Chorus]
We all want to believe in love,
We all want to believe in something,

Bigger than just us,
We all want to be a part,
Of a greater picture,
Singing in our heart,
Yeah bigger than just us!

It fills the universe,
With lot’s of skies above,

It rescues from our hearts with love,

(we all want to believe in love)
That’s what’s bigger than us! (bigger than us!)

(C’mon!)
It’s love, it’s love, it’ love!

(C’mon!)
It’s love, it’s love, it’ love!

It’s love, it’s love! (it’s love, it’s love!)

(C’mon!)

We all want to believe in love,
We all want to believe in something,

Bigger than just us!
