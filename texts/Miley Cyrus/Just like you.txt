(Yeah, yeah)
So what you see
Is only half the story
There's an other side of me
I'm a girl, you know
But I'm someone else too
If you only knew

It's a crazy life
But I'm alright

(Chorus:)
I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all I'm just like you

(yeah, yeah)

Don't wanna be trated differently
I wanna keep it all inside
Half the time I got my name in the lights
The other half in by your side

It's a crazy life
But I'm just fine

(Chorus:)
I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all I'm just like you

Yeah-ee yeah

Can't you see I'm just an ordinary girl
Livin' in an extraordinary world
Tryin' to live
Tryin' to learn
Tryin' to jus be who I am

(Who I am)

(Chorus:)
I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream
so yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all I'm just like you

I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream
so yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all I'm just like you
