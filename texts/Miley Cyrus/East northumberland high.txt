My problem isn't that I miss you,
'Cuz I don't,
My problem isn't that I kissed you,
Woah oh.

I figured out,
That you're nothin' that I thought you're about,
You're just caught in a place,
It's what time will erase in my heart.

You're my type of guy I guess,
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High,
For the rest of my life,
But people change,
Thank God I did.

Just because I liked you back then,
It doesn't mean I like you now,
Just because I liked you back then,
It doesn't mean I like you.

Your problem's not for lack of tryin',
'Cuz you do,
It's just that you act you best when your lyin'
Woah oh.

Now you're standing here,
Thanks you's what I wanted to hear,
But you got it all wrong,
I've already moved on, My dear.

You're my type of guy I guess,
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High,
For the rest of my life,
But people change,
Thank God I did.

Just because I liked you back then,
It doesn't mean I like you now,

Just because I liked you back then,
It doesn't mean I like you.

When you're standing near me,
I don't see so clearly,
The feelings are still powerfull,
But when I take two steps away,
It shakes some light on my day.

Yeah you can't go back,
It's all in the past,
Guess you gotta laugh at it.

You're my type of guy I guess,
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High,
For the rest of my life,
But people change,
Thank God I did.

And if there's some confusion,
Let me tell ya you're just dillusional,
Get a clue,
'Cuz people change,
Thank God I did,
Thank God I did,
Thank God I did.

Just because I liked you back then,
It doesn't mean I like you now,
Just because I liked you back then,
It doesn't mean I like you,
Doesn't mean I like you.

Just because I liked you back then,
It doesn't mean I like you now,

Rock and Roll.
Rockkkk
