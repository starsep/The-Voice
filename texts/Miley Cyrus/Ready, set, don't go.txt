She's gotta do what she's gotta do
And I've gotta like it or not
She's got dreams too big for this town
And she needs to give 'em a shot
Whatever they are

MILEY:
Looks like I'm all ready to leave
There's Nothing left to pack

BILLY RAY:
There ain't no room for me in that car
Even if she asked me to tag along
God I gotta be strong

MILEY:
I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life
As ready as I've ever been
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes
The prize is mine to win

BILLY RAY:
She's waitin' on my blessings before she hits that
open road
Baby get ready

MILEY:
(Oh I'm ready)

BILLY RAY:
Get set
Don't go

MILEY:
Looks like things are fallen into place
Feels like they're fallen apart

BILLY RAY:
I painted this big ol' smile on my face
To hide my broken heart
If only she knew

MILEY:
That this is where you don't say what you want so bad to say
This is where I want to but I won't get in the way
Of her and her dreams
And spreadin' her wings

MILEY:
(I'm ready to fly)

I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life
As ready as I've ever been
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes
The prize is mine to win

BILLY RAY:
She's waitin' on my blessings before she hits that
open road
Baby get ready
Get set
Don't go

MILEY:
I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life
As ready as I've ever been

BILLY RAY:
baby be alright

MILEY:
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes
The prize is mine to win (I'll be OK)

BILLY RAY:
She's waitin' on my blessings before she hits that
open road
Baby get ready (I gotta go)
Get set
Please don't go

Don't go
(I gotta go now, I'm ready)
Don't go

MILEY:
(I'll be alright, I'll be Ok
know that I'll be thinking of you each and every day)

BILLY RAY:
She's gotta do what she's gotta do

MILEY:
Let me go now.
She's gotta do what she's gotta do
I gotta do what I gotta do
