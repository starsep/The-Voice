Put on your coolest dress and your hottest pair of shoes, c'mon, let's go oh
Get in my car, turn the radio on up high, I said high
At the red light, boys trying to get the digits, but we say bye bye
Cos we're heading to the club, nothing's gonna stop us now, let's go oh

Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's go 
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's go 
Are you ready? Are you...

Yeah, I'm comin' up with all my girls
We're gonna party like there's never a worry 'cause
Good times rule, said "No curfew"
We showin' off our moves, the breeze so cool
Let your hair down
Tonight you get to be a superstar
You're living like a superstar rrrrrrr

So we're flirting with the dude at the door 'til he says we're okay, hey
(Say word, OK) 
Move the velvet rope back off, get out of our way, hey
(C'mon, c'mon) 
All the guys got their eyes on us as we're moving out to the floor, oh
Tryin' to waste our time, but we're doing what we came here for
(We're here to dance, baby) oh

Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's go 
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's go

We get Red Carpet Love when we come stepping up
The boys keep dropping their jaws, can never get enough
We make 'em stop and stare, we see them everywhere
And now you know who we are, tonight you're living like a superstar
