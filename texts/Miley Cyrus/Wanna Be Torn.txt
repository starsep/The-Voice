Maybe it\\\'s the things I say,
Maybe I should think before I speak
But I thought that I knew enough
To know myself and do what\\\'s right for me
And these walls I\\\'m building now 
You used to bring them down
The tears I\\\'m crying out
You used to wipe away

I thought you said it was easy,
listening to your heart
I thought you said I\\\'d be ok
So why am I breaking apart?
Don\\\'t wanna be torn (x4)

Now maybe I have to choose between 
what I want and what you think I need
Cause I\\\'ll always be a little girl
But even little girls still got to dream
Now it all feels like a fight
You were always on my side
But lonley I\\\'ve been now
You used to make it go away

I thought you said it was easy,
listening to your heart
I thought you said I\\\'d be ok
So why am I breaking apart?
Don\\\'t wanna be torn 

Why is all this so confusing, complicating and consuming
Why did all this made me angry 
I wanna go back to being happy
These tears I\\\'m crying out
You used to wipe away

I thought you said it was easy,
listening to your heart
I thought you said I\\\'d be ok
So why am I breaking apart?
Don\\\'t wanna be torn (x8)
