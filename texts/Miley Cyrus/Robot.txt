It's been like this from the start,
one piece after another to make my heart,
you mistake the game for being smart,
“stand here”, “sell this”, and “hit your mark”
but the sound of the steel,
and the crush and the grind,
it all screams "who am I to decide my life?"
but in time it'll die,
there's nothing left inside,
just rusted metal that was never even mine

I would scream,
but I'm just this hallow shell,
waiting here,
begging “please”
set me free so I can feel

hey!
stop trying to live my life for me,
I need to breathe,
I'm not your robot
Stop telling me I'm part of this big machine
I'm breaking free,
can't you see?
I can love,
I can speak,
without somebody else operating me,
you gave me eyes and now I see,
I'm not your robot,
I'm just me

All this time,
I've been misled,
There was nothing but cross-wires in my head,
I've been taught to think about what I feel,
doesn't matter at all until you say it's real

I would scream,
but I'm just this hallow shell,
waiting here,
begging “please”
set me free so I can feel

hey!
stop trying to live my life for me,
I need to breathe,
I'm not your robot
Stop telling me I'm part of this big machine
I'm breaking free,
can't you see?
I can love,
I can speak,
without somebody else operating me,
you gave me eyes and now I see,
I'm not your robot,
I'm just me

I'm not your robot,
I'm just me

I'm not your robot

I would scream,
but I'm just this hallow shell,
waiting here,
breaking free,
set me free so I can feel

stop trying to live my life for me,
I need to breathe,
I'm not your robot
Stop telling me I'm part of this big machine
I'm breaking free,
can't you see?
I can love,
I can speak,
without somebody else operating me,
you gave me eyes and now I see,
I'm not your robot,
I'm just me

I'm not your robot,
I'm just me

I'm not your robot!
