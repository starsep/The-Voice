I'd give up my life cause I know it's a chance worth takin'
Don't close your eyes give all you have cause you'll succeed soon
As someone said give liberty or death
I would fight for what I would believe in
It's worth it (worth it)

It's worth it you mess up once in a while just don't give up
It's worth it, it's worth it (worth it)
[Repeat 2 times]

I'd rather die then just give up for what I believe in
I thought it was okay when they said a warning then I got to know
That I was for sure that I was standing up for what I believe in

It's worth it you mess up once in awhile just don't give up
It's worth it, it's worth it (worth it)
[Repeat 2 times]

[Speak]:
Never give up believe and do it
Don't let anyone tell you you can't do it cause you can

Its worth it believe in it believe in
it it's worth it worth------- it oh yea

[Shout]
ITS WORTH IT
