Every week’s the same
Stuck in school so lame
My parents say that I’m lazy
Getting up at 8 is crazy


Tired of hearing what to do
So unfair,
So uncool


Days too long
And I'm holding on
Till I hear the bell ring

Cuz it's the time when
The time when

We’re gonna Breakout
Let the party start
We’re gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts

We’re gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart
Uh oh, all over again.
We’re gonna wakeup everyone we know
We’re gonna have some fun, gonna loose control

Feels so good, to let go-oh-oh.

Hangout, its something we like to do
With my friends, every mess were into HA
These are the last songs that we chose
None of them are here to remember you

Days too long
And I’m holding on
Till I hear the bell ring

Cuz it's the time when
The time when

We’re gonna Breakout
Let the party start
We’re gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We’re gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart
Uh oh, all over again.
We’re gonna wakeup everyone we know
We’re gonna have some fun, gonna loose control

Feels so good, to let go-oh-oh.

I wish it would never end,
Spending time with my friends.
Oh with my friends!

Breakout
Let the party start
We’re gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We’re gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart
Uh oh, all over again.
We’re gonna wakeup everyone we know
We’re gonna have some fun, gonna loose control

Feels so good, to let go!

Breakout
Let the party start
We’re gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We’re gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart
Uh oh, all over again.
We’re gonna wakeup everyone we know.
We’re gonna have some fun, gonna loose control.

Feels so good, to let go-oh-oh!
