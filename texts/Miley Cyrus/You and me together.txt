Looks like we found ourselves
Up against a wall
In need of a little help
But no one wants to call
After all we been through
Do we let our friendship end

You need me and I need you
No, we will not break
Never break
But even if we bend

Yeah it´s you and me together
I'm always on your side
no one,no one,no one,can ever change it,
come on let em try
cause it's you and me together now

Anyone can have a day
When their heart is on their sleeve
No one wants to see it our way
Can't agree to disagree
You'd think it'd be easier
But it feels like you just can't win
But somehow we'll make it work

Cause we deserve it
You know we're worth it
You can't give up on friends

Cuz it´s you and me together
I'm always on your side
no one, no one, no one, can ever change it
come on let em try
cause it's you and me together now ...

together now ...

Ohh... now now now

Cuz it´s you and me together 
I'm always on your side ...ohhhh...
no one, no one, no one, can ever change it
come on let em try 
cause it's you and me together now 

Cuz it´s you and me together
I'm always on your side
no one, no one, no one, can ever change it
come on let em try
cause it's you and me together now
