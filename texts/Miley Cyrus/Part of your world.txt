Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection is complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl,
The girl who has everything?
Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here you'd think:
"Sure, she's got evertyhing"
I've got gadgets and gizmos of plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs?
I've got twenty!
But who cares? No big deal
I want more...
I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancing
Walking around on those...
(What do you call them? Oh, feet)
Flipping your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down the...
(What's that word again? Street...)
Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wondering free, wish I could be
Part of that world...
What would I give
If I could live out of these waters
What would I pay
To spend a day warm on the sand
Betcha on land they understand
Bet they don't reprimend their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimming
Ready to stand...
I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask them my questions and get some answers
What's the fire and why does it
(What's the word? Burn...)
When is it my turn?
When is it my turn? To be
Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wondering free, wish I could be
Part of that world
Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wondering free, wish I could be
Part of that world
