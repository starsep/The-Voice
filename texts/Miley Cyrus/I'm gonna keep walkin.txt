I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave everything that i had
But you left me in the cold
But still I had faith
Somehow I believed (I believed, I believed)
That if I keep love in my heart
It will find it's way to me

I could fight, seek revenge
But that's not who I am
No I'm not givin in
I will rise above

I'm gonna keep walkin thought it may seem far
I'm gonna keep reachin when life gets too hard
Not gonna let you bring me down, I'll take the high road
I'm gonna keep climbin till I see the top
I'm gonna keep tryin though I may get lost
Not gonna let you bring me down, I'll take the high road

I'm gonna get by on the high road (Yes I will)
I'm gonna get by on the high road

This pain that I feel
I will overcome
I know somewhere deep down inside
Is a pain that makes us strong

I could curse, I could shout
Take the easy way out
I'll forgive you somehow
I will rise above

I'm gonna keep walkin thought it may seem far
I'm gonna keep reachin when life gets too hard
Not gonna let you bring me down, I'll take the high road
I'm gonna keep climbin till I see the top
I'm gonna keep tryin though I may get lost
Not gonna let you bring me down, I'll take the high road

Oh I know I'll get by, to be free
I can't keep it inside (no I can't keep it inside)
I may fall sometimes but I will survive

I'm gonna keep reachin
I'm gonna keep climbin
I'm gonna keep tryin

I'm gonna keep walkin thought it may seem far
I'm gonna keep reachin when life gets too hard
Not gonna let you bring me down, I'll take the high road

I'm gonna get by on the high road
I'm gonna get by on the high road (Take the high road)
I'm gonna be fine on the high road
I'm gonna get by on the high road
I'm gonna get by on the high road
I'm gonna be fine on the high road
