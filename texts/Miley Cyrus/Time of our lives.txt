Seems like were holding on forever
I gotta let it go
Times up you pushed me to surrender (tonight)
Who knows whats happens now whatever
Where ever the wind blows
And I'm there as long as were together
Alright...

Lets have the time of our lives!
Like theres noone else around
just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
Lets have the time of our lives
Till the lights burn out
Lets laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Lets have the time of our lives!

Dreamers don't care if its right
I think im really into you
Restless lets leave it all behind
And Tonight

Crazy when you cross my mind
Oh the trouble we could get into
So what lets just give this a try
Alright

Lets have the time of our lives!
Like theres noone else around
just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
Till the lights burn out
Lets laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Lets have the time of our lives!

Lookin back what are we waitin
for?
Take the chance Nows all we got for sure!

Lets have the time of our lives!
Like theres noone else around
just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
Till the lights burn out
Lets laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Lets have the time of our lives!
