Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la

You used to call me your angel
Said I was sent straight down from heaven
You'd hold me close in your ah-arms
I love the way you felt so strong

I never wanted you to leave
I wanted you to stay here holding me

I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear
Every once in a while

And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know

I miss you
Sha la la la la
I miss you

You used to call me your dreamer
And now I'm living out my deam
Oh, how I wish you could see
Everything that's happening for me

I'm thinking back on the past
It's true that time is flying by too fast

I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear
Every once in a while

And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know

I miss you
Sha la la la la
I miss you

I know you're in a better place, yeah
But I wish that I could see your face, oh
I know you're where you need to be
Even though it's not here with me

I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear
Every once in a while

And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know

I miss you
Sha la la la la

I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear
Every once in a while

And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know

I miss you
Sha la la la la
I miss you
(I miss you)
