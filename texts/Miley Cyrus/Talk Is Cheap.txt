Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Woohoo
[x2]

Im alone,its just me
And im watchin' tv
And im always,oh so bored at home

I get up,I get out
Drive my car way downtown
Keep on calling ,but your never around

See my friends out tonight
Under these city lights
In the club 'til someone starts a fight
And we get in the car
So know,where you are
So pissed off,always hangin 'round

And im so tired..
Your fired!

Im so jealous,restless,relentless
Thats just me
Im so crazy,lately
Come on,let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need
You know what they say
When theres a will theres a way
Lies are free,talk is cheap

Ay ay ay ay ay ay ya ya
Woohoo Woohoo

Now we're out in the street
And we're sweatin' the heat
And we move with the traffic
And the beat

I dont care if you choke
When you light up your smoke
Its the one thing I cant call my own

It's so tragic..
Im so manic!

Im so jealous,restless,relentless
Thats just me
Im so crazy,lately
Come on,let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need
You know what they say
When theres a will theres a way
Lies are free,talk is cheap

Ay ay ay ay ay ay ya ya
Woohoo Woohoo

Im so tired..
Your fired!

Im so jealous,restless,relentless
Thats just me
Im so crazy,lately
Come on,let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need
You know what they say
When theres a will theres a way
Lies are free,talk is cheap

Ay ay ay ay ay ya ya ay
Woohoo Woohoo

Talk is cheap

Lies are free,talk is cheap.
