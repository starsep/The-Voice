How did I get here
I turned around and there you where
Didn't think twice or rationalize
Cause somehow I knew
That there was more than just chemistry
I mean I knew you were kind of into me
But I figured it's too good to be true

I said pinch me, where's the catch this time
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get use to this guy

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in a blink
Of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody
Like you were a million to one
I Can't believe it
You're one in a million

All this time I was looking for love
Trynna make things work that weren't good
Enough
Till I thought I'm through, said I'm done
Then stumbled into the arms of the one

You're making me laugh about the silliest
Stuff
Say that I'm your diamond in the ruff
When I'm mad at you;
You come with your velvet
Touch

Can't believe I'm so lucky
I have never felt so happy
Every time i see that sparkle in your eyes

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in a blink
Of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody
Like you were a million to one
Can´t believe it
You´re one in a million

All this time I was looking for love
Trynna make things work that weren't good
Enough
Till I thought I'm through, said I'm done
Then stumbled into the arms of the one

I said pinch me, where's the catch this time
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get use to this guy

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in a blink
Of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody
Like you were a million to one
Can't believe it
You're one in a million
