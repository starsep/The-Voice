I road all night on a big old bus

You came a long way to be with us

Your paying money, to see a show

Yeah lets get ready cuz here we go

Get on your feet, cuz i'm plugged in

So come on, Lets do this



I'll turn it on

I'll crank it up

I'll show you all what im made of

I'm getting loud

I'll wear it out

I'll bring the roof in this house down

I know just what you came here for

and i want to hear you scream and more

Get on your feet

You know you cant resist

Lets do this



Lets do this



Dont call this work

But im paid to play

And the real party starts backstage

And all my friends

They sing my songs

I wish you all could come along

To take a picture

To show your friends

So come on, lets do this



[CHORUS]



Everybody

Come on nows the time to get loud

Throw your hands up

Let me hear you shout it out

All my people

Let me see you jumping up and down

Let me hear the words

You know, you know im singing now

Freak out, Scream shout

This is what its all about

Let me hear those now





I'll turn it on

I'll crank it up

I'll show you all what im made of

I get loud, I wear it out

I'll bring the roof in this house down

I know just what you came here for

and i want to hear you scream and more

Get on your feet

You know you cant resist

Lets do this
