Well it's good to hear your voice
I hope your doing fine
And if you ever wonder I'm lonely here tonight
Lost here in this moment and time keeps slipping by
And if I could have just one wish
I'd have you by my side

Oooh oh I miss you
Oooh oh I need you

And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed no one can take your place
It gets harder everyday

Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home I'll be coming home
And if you ask me I will stay, I will stay

Well I try to live without you
The tears fall from my eyes
I'm alone and I feel empty
God I'm torn apart inside

I look up at the stars
Hoping your doing the same
Somehow I feel closer and I can hear you say

Oooh oh I miss you
Oooh oh I need you

And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed no one can take your place
It gets harder everyday

Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home I'll be coming home
And if you ask me I will stay, I will stay
Always Stay! 
I never wanna lose you
And if I had to I would chose you
So stay, please always stay
You're the one that I hold onto
Cause my heart would stop without you

And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed no one can take your place
It gets harder everyday

Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home I'll be coming home
And if you ask me I will stay, I will stay
I'll always stay

And love you more than I did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home I'll be coming home
And if you ask me I will stay, I will stay
I will stay
