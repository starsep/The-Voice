Sometimes I walk a little faster
In the school hallway
Just to get next to you
Some days I spend a little extra
Time in the morning
Dress to impress you

Guess you don't notice
Guess you don't need this
Sad you're not seein' what you're missin'
On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dyin' to say

I'm unusual
Not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai chi practicing
Snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
I might even be a rock star

Sometimes I wish when the phone rings
That it would be you
Saying let's hang out
Then you confess
That there's something special between us
Why don't we find out

You don't even know me
Guess you don't need me
Sad you're not seein' what you're missin'
On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dyin' to say

I'm unusual
Not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai chi practicing
Snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
I might even be a...

...rock star
If you only knew the real me
I might even be a rock star
I'm telling you that we are meant to be
Now wouldn't it be nice if you could see
That I really am a rock star

I'm unusual
Not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai chi practicing
Snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
Rocking in wherever we are
'cause I really am a rock star
