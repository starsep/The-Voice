(Miley)
Sometimes I wonder
If eveything changed
How would we make out
And now suddenly
Thunder and everything changed
Theres this big dark cloud hovering
Hovering x3

(Trace)
You always said that we'd make it through

(Miley)
Trumbeling, Stumbleling, Fumbleling,
Those Are The words that saying
that I'm leaving you
I'M Leaving you

Go Through The Motions Like
Everythings Settled But Its
Inside Out
And It Makes Us Uncomfortable
Still Holding On
When Theres All This Doubt
Hovering
Hovering x3

(Trace)
You Always Said That We'd Make
Through

(MIley)
Traveling,Stumbling,Fumbling

Those are the words That Saying Im
Leaving Youu
I'm Leaving You

Maybye Were Just Older,Just A Little Older
Cuz The Fact That This is Over
The Fact That This is Over With You

Hovering
Hovering
Hovering

(Trace)
You Always Said That We'd Make it Through

(Miley)
Traveling,Stumbling,Fumblingg
Those ARe The Words That Say
Im Leaving You

Stumbling
Thos are the words that I'm Leaving
