When I feel all alone and nobody knows
Still gotta smile for a while
I cant let it show
Dry my tears(dry my tears)
Have no fears(have no fears)
(and when im)(and when im)
Backstage feelin down and the lights come on
No time to worry gotta hurry gotta sing my song
Gotta shake it off (shake it off)
And strike a pose here i go

Snap my fingers just like that
Dont get what I want and thats a fact
Snap my fingers just like that
Dont get what I want (just cuz I want it)

Im super cool
Super hot
Livin like a rockstar
You think im super
You think im super

On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
Im super super! Im super duper!

So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me

Everybody's watchin me
Its never as easy as it seems
To be super super
(to be super super girl)

When I walk in the room everybody stops
Cameras flashin people fighting for the better shot
They like my hair, and the clothes I wear
Everybody wants to know what im doin next
Sometimes I wish I could stay home just be by myself
I wanna be(I wanna be)
What the world cant see
Cant u see?

Snap my fingers just like that
Dont get what I want and thats a fact
Snap my fingers just like that
Dont get what I want (just cuz I want it)

Im super cool
Super hot
Livin like a rockstar
You think im super
You think im super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
Im super super! Im super duper!

So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me

Everybody's watchin me
Its never as easy as it seems
To be super super
(to be super super girl)

Wish you could see im like everybody else
Struggling to let go and always be myself

Im super cool
Super hot
Super!
Im super super
Im super super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
Im super super! Im super super!

So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me

Everybody's watchin me
Its never as easy as it seems
To be super super
To be super super girl
