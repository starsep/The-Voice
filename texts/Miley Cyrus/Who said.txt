I'm more than just
You're average girl
I'd like to turn me up
And show the world
Oh yeah

'Cause some can talk the talk
This girl just wants to rock
I'm individual
I'm not like anyone

I can be glamourous just like you see in all the magazines
I can be cool as ice
Or anything I wanna be

Who said, who said I can't be superman
I say, I say that I know I can
Who said, who said I won't be president
I say, I say you ain't seen nothing yet

Oh yeah. Yeah

Who wanna make some noise
Every girl has a choice
To live their own parade
I'll do it my way

Aw!

I can be soft and sweet
Or louder than the radio (radio)
I can be sphisticated or totally go, out of control
I've got the choice

Who said, who said I can't be superman
I say, I say that I know I can
Who said, who said I'm not electrifying
I say, I say there's no holding back
Then get right on track
cause you control the game
So let em know your name
No limitations on imagination
Imagine that!

Yeah!

Who said, who said I can't be worldwide
I say, I say time is all I got
Who said, who said I can't be ten feet tall
That I can have it all

Who said, who said I can't be superman
I say, I say that I know I can
Who said, who said I won't be president
I say, I say you ain't seen nothing yet
You ain't seen nothing yet

Oh. Yeah
Who said
Come on. Yeah
That's right
