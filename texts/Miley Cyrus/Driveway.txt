After twelve
Not so well
Won't the breakfast 
Sisters tell
What's 'round 
This bend
No disgrace
About this
Only thing 
I dare to chase
You down again
You know

Nothing hurts 
Like losing
When ya know 
What's really gone
Except all the blame
And I'm choosin
Won't you long

I tried it your way
But I got 
Nothing to show
It's been 
The same, same
And the story's 
Getting old
I guess the driveway
Will be 
The end of the road
For us it's too late
And the credits 
Start to roll

A lot to say
About today
Let the radio 
Break the silence
As we drive
A kiss goodbye
Not this time
Don't remember 
About this song
I never liked 

Ya know
Nothing hurts 
Like losing
When ya know 
It's already gone
It's just 
All the blame
And I'm choosin
Won't you long

I tried it your way
But I got 
Nothing to show
It's been 
The same, same
And the story's 
Getting old
I guess the driveway
Will be the end 
Of the road
For us it's too late
And the credits 
Start to roll

I thought you knew 
Everything about me
But I know
Nothing at all
I watched your tail 
Lights fading
I'll try to do it all
I remember 
What it feels like
To know love
And have it taken away
I can't think of what 
I learned right now
But I'll thinking 
Of it someday

I tried it your way
But I got 
Nothing to show
It's been 
The same, same
And the story's 
Getting old
I guess the driveway
Will be 
The end of the road
For us it's too late
And the credits 
Start to roll

Roooooooooool
Credits start to roll 
(Oooh)

I guess the driveway
End of the road 
(End of the road)

Woo (woo)
Woo (woo)
