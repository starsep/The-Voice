I got my sight set on you
And i'm ready to wait
I have a heart that will,
Never be tame..
I knew you were something special
When you spoke my name
Now i can't wait, to see you again

I've got a way of knowing
When something is right
I feel like i must have known you
In another life
Cuz i felt this deep conection
When you looked in my eyes
Now i can't wait, to see you again

[Chorus]
The last time i freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when
you ask me what i'm thinking about
Felt like i couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said:
"Oh, she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'til then
Whoa Whoa I, I can't wait, to see you again

I got this crazy feeling, deep inside
When you called and asked to see me
Tomorrow ni-ight
I'm not a mind reader
But i'm reading the signs
Then you can't wait, to see me again..

[Chorus]
The last time i freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when
you ask me what i'm thinking about
Felt like i couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said:
"Oh, she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'til then
Whoa Whoa I, I can't wait, to see you again

I got my sight set on you
And i'm ready to wait

[Chorus]
The last time i freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when
you ask me what i'm thinking about
Felt like i couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said:
"Oh, she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'til then
Whoa whoa I, I can't wait, to see you again
Whoa whoa I, I can't wait
To See You Again
