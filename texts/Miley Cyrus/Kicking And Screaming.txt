Don't get me waiting
Anticipating
Treating me like a fool
I have news for you
I'm turning my back
I'm dropping a bomb on you
Ah
You want me
You need me
Believe me
You'll be crawling
You love me
You hate me
Believe me
you'll come crawling

[Chorus]
So get down and get off
Let me show you what you'll be missing
We break up you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming

Don't get me guessing
On your favourite obsession
To give me a lame excuse
It's with me that your messing
At the same old confession
Your no one that something would lose
Ah
Watch out now
A black out
There's no doubt
You can't have it
Control you
I'll own you
I'll show you but you still can't have it

[Chorus]
So get down and get off
Let me show you what you'll be missing
We break up you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming
So get down and get off
You're not the only one that I've been missing
We break up you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming

You'll be kicking and screaming [2x]
I'm so deceiving
You'll be kicking and screaming!

Watch out now
You'll find out
You'll cry out
There's no one above me
I play hard
Don't run far
Come back now
I really do like you

[Chorus]
So get down and get off
Let me show you what you'll be missing
We break up you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming
So get down and get off
You're not the only one that I've been missing
We break up you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming

You'll be kicking and screaming [2x]
Kicking and screaming [2x]
