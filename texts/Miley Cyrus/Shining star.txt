Yeah, it's B5, yeah
Let's go, yeah, come on

When you wish upon a star, your dreams will take you very far, yeah yeah yeah yeah
When you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems, oh yeah, come on
What you'd see on night of clear, in the sky so very dear

[Chorus]
You're a shining star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, what you can truly be, truly be

Yeah, it's B5, yeah yeah

Shining star come into view, shining watchful light on you, yeah
Gives you strength to carry on
Makes your body big and strong
On the adventure of the sun
It's all awake and just begun

Thought I had to stir the mood
That's it now I got my own oh yeah

So if you find yourself in need
Why dont you listen to these words of heat
Be a giant or grain of sand, words of wisdom yes I can

[Repeat Chorus]

You're a shining star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What can truly be
You're a shining star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What can truly be

Shining star for you to see, what your life can truly be
Shining star for you to see, what your life can truly be
Shining star for you to see, what your life can truly be
