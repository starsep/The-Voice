Ooohoo...

I feel like I'm a million miles away
From my self more and more these days
I've been down so many open roads
But they never lead me home
And now I just don't know

Who I really am,
How it's gonna be,
Is there something that I can't see?
I wanna understand

Maybe I will never be who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Maybe who I am today ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be
Every part of me

So I'll try
Try to sort things out
And find myself
Get my feet back on the ground
It'll take time, but i know I'll be alright
'Cause nothing much has changed on the inside

It's hard to figure out
How it's gonna be
'Cause I don't really know now
I wanna understand

Maybe I will never be who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Maybe who I am today ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be every part of me

I don't wanna wait too long
To find out where I'm meant to belong
I've always wanted to be where i am today
But I never thought I'd feel this way

Maybe I will never be who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Maybe who I am today ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be every part of me

Every part of me
