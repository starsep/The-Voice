I don't want a lot for Christmas 

There is just one thing I need 

I don't care about the presents 

Underneath the Christmas tree 

I just want you for my own 

More than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true 

All I want for Christmas is you 



I don't want a lot for Christmas there is just one thing I need 

I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree 

I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace 

Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas day 

I just want you for my own more than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true all I want for Christmas is you 

You 



I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow 

I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe 

I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick 

I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click 

'Cause I just want you here tonight holding on to me so tight 

What more can I do oh baby all I want for Christmas is you 

You 



Although all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere 

And the sound of children's laughter fills the air 

And everyone is singing I hear those sleigh bells ringing 

Santa won't you bring me the one I really need 

Won't you please bring my baby to me 



Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas this is all I'm asking for 

I just want to see my baby standing right outside my door 

Oh I just want him for my own more than you could ever know 

Make my wish come true oh baby all I want for Christmas is 

You
