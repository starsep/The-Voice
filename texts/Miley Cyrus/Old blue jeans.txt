You walk away from me tonight,
not knowing the real me,
Cuz you believe in all the hype,
I just stepped out a magazine,

Take away the glamour, the world, let it show,
And forget everything you know,
Take away the mirrors, the limo, the lights,
'Cuz I don't wanna dress up tonight

I'm gonna put on my Old Blue Jeans,
I'm gonna walk out of here and into the street,
Would you put up resistance,
Would it make a difference,
Would you know the real me,
Me and my old blue jeans,

You think I'm unapproachable,
That I don't feel enough,
You should read a book, cover to cover,
And not be so quick to judge,

Take away the glamour, the makeup that glows,
And forget everything you know,
Take away the mirrors, the trick of the lights,
'Cuz I don't wanna dress up tonight

I'm gonna put on my Old Blue Jeans,
I'm gonna walk out of here and into the street,
Would you put up resistance,
Would it make a difference,
Would you know the real me,
Me and my old blue jeans, (x2)

I wanna show you what you get!

I'm gonna put on my Old Blue Jeans,
I'm gonna walk out of here and into the street,
Would you put up resistance,
Would it make a difference,
Would you know the real me,
Me and my old blue jeans, (x3)
