So I might slip again 
Let it in now and then 
That don't mean anything 
I'm still good

I look around me 
How did I get here 
Not part of my plan

I ended up in 
A situation 
Wasn't in my hands

I think about it 
When I want to give up 
How to keep on going 
How to keep my chin up 
Somehow I know it 
I'm not gonna give up 
Never gonna give up

So I might slip again 
Let it in now and then 
That don't mean anything 
I'm still good

Tryin' to be my best 
When I fall it's a mess 
Pick myself up again 
I'm still good

I'm still good 
I'm still good

When days are like that 
And I can't shake 'em 
It's weighin' on my mind

So I'm just sayin' 
I'm only human 
Life gets you down sometimes

I think about it 
When I want to give up 
How to keep on going 
How to keep my chin up 
Somehow I know it 
I'm not gonna give up 
Never gonna give up

So I might slip again 
Let it in now and then 
That don't mean anything 
I'm still good

Tryin' to be my best 
When I fall it's a mess 
Pick myself up again 
I'm still good

So I might slip again 
Let it in now and then 
That don't mean anything 
I'm still good

Tryin' to be my best 
When I fall it's a mess 
Pick myself up again 
I'm still good

Life puts up a fight with me 
But I can take on anything 
I'm gonna make it real, this dream I believe in

I think about it 
When I want to give up 
How to keep on going 
How to keep my chin up 
Somehow I know it 
I'm not gonna give up 
Never gonna give up

So I might slip again 
Let it in now and then 
That don't mean anything 
I'm still good

Tryin' to be my best 
When I fall it's a mess 
Pick myself up again 
I'm still good

So I might slip again 
Let it in now and then 
That don't mean anything 
I'm still good

Tryin' to be my best 
When I fall it's a mess 
Pick myself up again 
I'm still good

I'm still good 
Pick myself up again 
I'm still good 
I'm still, I'm still good
