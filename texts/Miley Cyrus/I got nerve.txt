We haven't met, and that's okay
'cause you will be asking for me one day
Don't want to wait in line
The moment is mine believe me

Don't close your eyes
'cause it's a chance worth takin?
And i think that i can show you

(chorus)
I know where i stand
I know who i am
I would never run away when life gets bad,
Everything i see
Every part of me
Gonna get what i deserve
I got nerve

Electrified, i'm on a wire
Getting together and we're on fire
What i said, you heard
Now i got you spinning

Don't close your mind
The words i use are open
And i think that i can show you

(chorus 2)

I know where i stand
I know who i am
I would never run away when life gets bad,
Everything i see
Every part of me
I know i can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what you like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink,
Everything i see
Every part of me
Gonna get what i deserve
I got nerve

(chorus 2)

I know where i stand
I know who i am
I would never run away when life gets bad,
Everything i see
Every part of me
I know i can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what you like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink,
Everything i see
Every part of me
Gonna get what i deserve
I got nerve

I know what you like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink,
Everything i see
Every part of me
Gonna get what i deserve
I got, i got nerve
