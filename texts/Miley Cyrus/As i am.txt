Gonna stay in bed today
Cuz I can't stand the light
Don't know why I get so down
I won't be much fun tonight
And I can't believe you still wanna hang around me
It's not so pretty all the time
You don't mind
To you it's alright

As I am is how you take me 
Never try to push
Make me different
When I talk you listen to me
As I am is how you want me
I know I've found the pieces missing
I'm looking at him

Not the girl you think you see
But maybe that's a lie
You almost know me better than me myself and I
Don't know a lot of things
But I know what I got
It's not so perfect everyday
I don't have to try
Cuz it all falls into place

As I am is how you take me 
Never try to push
Make me different
When I talk you listen to me

As I am is how you want me
I know I've found the pieces missing
I'm looking at him

Face to face
Eye to eye
You're standing there
Feels good on the inside
I don't mind
I don't care
You're standing there
Seein me for the first time
Seein me for the first time
Seein me for the first time

As I am is how you take me 
Never try to push
Make me different
When I talk you listen to me
As I am is how you want me
I know I've found the pieces missing
I'm looking at him

Found the pieces missng
Take me as I am
When I talk you listen 
Take me as I am
Found the pieces missing
Take me as I am
