These four walls 
They whisper to me 
They know a secret 
I knew they would not keep 
Didn't take long for the room to fill with dust 
And these four walls came down around us 

It must have been something that send me out of my head 
With the words so radical 
And not what I meant 
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left 
Just me and these four walls again 

It's hard now to let you be 
I won't make excuses 
I've made my peace 
Didn't take long for me to lose the trust 
'Cause these four walls were not strong enough 
ooooh 
It must have been something that send me out of my head 
With the words so radical 
And not what I meant 
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left 
Just me and these four walls again 

Yeah, it's difficult 
Watching us fade 
Knowing it's all my fault 
My mistake 
Yeah, it's difficult 
Letting you down 
Knowing it's all my fault 
You're not around 

It must have been something that send me out of my head 
With the words so radical 
And not what I meant 
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left 
Just me and these four walls again 
Again
Ooh 
These four walls again
