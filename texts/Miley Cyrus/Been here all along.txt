Mmmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sunrise and I lift up my head
Then I smile at your picture sittin' next to my bed
Sunset and you're feeling okay
'Cause you smile at the letter that I sent you today

And I can't wait 'til I see you again
And we both say remember when
The band played on the 4th of July
And you held me on your shoulders way up high

You're still there for me 
Wherever "there" might be 
And if an ocean lies between us 
I'll send a message across the sea 
That you can sleep tonight 
Knowing it's alright
I believe that you are listening to my song 
You're with me 
You've been here all along 
You've been here all along

Back then you walked me to school 
Told me to be careful and to follow the rules 
Fast forward, you taught me to drive 
You gave me the keys and we went for a ride

And I can't wait 'til I see you again 
And we both say remember when 
I'm holding on to moments like that 
And I know that they're coming back

You're still there for me 
Wherever "there" might be
And if an ocean lies between us 
I'll send a message across the sea 
That you can sleep tonight 
Knowing it's alright
I believe that you are listening to my song
You're with me
You've been here all along
Yeah

All along the way
I keep you in my heart and in my prayers 
You'll always be the one who cares the most 
Counting on the day 
I see you running up to say 
I missed you, I missed you

You're still there for me 
Wherever "there" might be 
And if an ocean lies between us 
I'll send a message across the sea 
That you can sleep tonight 
Knowing it's alright
I believe that you are listening to my song

You're still there for me 
Wherever "there" might be 
And if an ocean lies between us 
I'll send a message across the sea 
That you can sleep tonight 
Knowing it's alright
I believe that you are listening to my song
You're with me
'Cause you're with me
You've been here all along
You've been here all along
Yeah
