A word is just a word
Until you mean what you say
A Love isn't a love
Til you give it away
We all got to give
Yeah something to give to make a change

Send it on
On and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us Strong
Shine a Light and Send it On

Just smile and the world will smile along with you
That small acts of love
Then the one will become two
If we take the chances
To change circumstances
Imagine all that we could do
If we...

Send it on
On and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us Strong
Shine a Light and Send it On
Send it on

There's Power in all the choices we make
So I'm starting now not a moment to wait
A word just a word
Until you mean what you say
A love isn't just a love
Until you give it away

Send it on
On and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us Strong
Shine a Light and Send it On
Send it on

Send it on
On and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will help things start
Make us Strong
Shine a Light and Send it On
Shine a Light and Send it On
Shine a Light and Send it On
