I come home 
In the morning light
My mother says 
When you gonna live 
Your life right
Oh mother dear 
We're not 
The fortunate ones
And girls 
They wanna have fun
Oh girls 
Just wanna have fun

The phone rings 
In the middle of the night
My father yells 
What you gonna do 
With your life
Oh, daddy dear you know 
You're still number one
But girls 
They wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Girls 
They wanna have fun
Oh girls 
Just wanna have fun

Some boys 
Take a beautiful girl
And hide her away 
From the rest of the world
I want to be the one 
To walk in the sun
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Girls
They want to have fun
Oh girls 
Just want to have fun
They wanna have fun
They wanna have fun
