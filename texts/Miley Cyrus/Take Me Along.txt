The city of angels is lonely tonight
They keep themselves alive by candle light.
So she can love you like I do
Look me in the eyes and say it's true
I ask myself is this love at all?
When I need you most you let me fall
I'm always here beside your face
So choose if you like and I'll pretend I'm okay...
(I'll be okay)

Chorus:
I-I don't understand
Why your leavin' me
I-I don't understand
How far that I can reach
Please, don't don't leave me here
Cause I am bleeding tears
I-I don't understand, why you can't take me along


You can pretend I don't exist
She'll seem so lazy everytime you kiss
I hope you hurt and the walls fall down
When you hear the sound that I'm okay.
(I'll be okay)

Chorus:
I-I don't understand
Why your leavin' me
I-I don't understand
How far that I can reach
Please, don't don't leave me here
Cause I am bleeding tears
I-I don't understand, why you can't take me along


I watched you leave away tonight
And the maidens eyes like the stars that shine
And through the tears I say goodbye
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe out

Chorus:
I-I don't understand
Why your leavin' me
I-I don't understand
How far that I can reach
Please, don't don't leave me here
Cause I am bleeding tears
I don't understand, why you can't take me along (x2)
