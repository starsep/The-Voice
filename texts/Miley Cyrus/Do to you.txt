I felt the need
To tell you
Something special and true
But you never listened
I gave my heart to you
And now I'm wondering
What did I ever do to you?

(Chorus:)
You turned around
You turned away
You turned me down
What can I say
Do you want me to live alone
Do you want me to live depressed
Why would you break my heart
Like that
All I wanna know is
What did I ever do to you

How come you did
That to me
You broke my heart
And it was kind of
Embarrassing
How it happened
In front of my friends

(Chorus)

What did I do to you
Did I ever break your heart
No no no oh

(Chorus)

And
What did I ever do to you
