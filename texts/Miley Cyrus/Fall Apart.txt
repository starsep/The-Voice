In my Life, Once or Twice Again
Chasin Fears with my Tears Falling

How could you do this to me
I thought that we were meant to be
you were my everything

And I wont fall apart
even though everything you do just breaks my heart
and when Im down
don't come around
you're with your babydoll,
maybe thats why you dont call
No more....
Just walk out of that door

Broken Heart is now Apart of me
This is not where i want to be

Your texts dont mean a thing
what do u expect to see
you're just a worthless being

And I wont fall apart
even though everything you do just breaks my heart
and when Im down
don't come around
you're with your babydoll,
maybe thats why you dont call
No more....
Just walk out of that door

Why are you standing here
Telling me things that draw a tear
why are you so near?

Living in this world together
I thought we'd last forever
you're making it so hard to say goodbye

Everything you do just lifts me up
even though we had that it wasn't enough
Just leave me along
Im fine on my own

And I wont fall apart
even though everything you do just breaks my heart
and when Im down
don't come around
you're with your babydoll,
maybe thats why you dont call
No more....
Just walk out of that door

In my life once or twice again...
