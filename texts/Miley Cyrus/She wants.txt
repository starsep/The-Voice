I came back to the beginning 
To give one more chance 
But the game does not rolled 
Why she wants 

Increasingly 

Chorus: 
It is either play 
Not for up to win 
She wants to change my way 
She wants 
She wants 
She wants you 
She wants 
She wants 
She wants to talk 

Once, it is already too 
But it still 
Whether or not she will return to the beginning 
Like me 
It is unjust 
And it will not stop bad 
Why am I going to the end 

Chorus: 
It is either play 
Not for up to win 
She wants to change my way 
She wants 
She wants 
She wants you 
She wants 
She wants 
She wants to talk 

I just 
We go back 
I will not stop 
In fighting 

Yeah, she wants 

Who she is a bad girl 
And poor 

She wants
