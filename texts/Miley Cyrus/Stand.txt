The story of a heart in need
Playing on my tv screen
While I sit back and watch it fade
There's gotta be a better way
Love is more than what you feel
Love is action, love is real
Break your side,let's turn the key
And be the change you wanna see
So get ready, com'on everybody
Are you ready to...

Stand, for what you believe in
Stand for all that is right
Stand when it's dark all around you
U can be that shining light
Stand when trouble comes calling
( for what you believe in )
You're gonna be all right
Stand just reach deep inside you
And be that shining light
STAND!
