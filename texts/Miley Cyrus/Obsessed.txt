 Why do I just lie awake and think of you
I need some sleep
Tomorrow I have things to do
Everytime I close my eyes I see your face
So I try to read
But all I do is lose my place

Am i obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
I do all the time

I just had to call you up and say hello
I know its 3 AM
And I saw you you a while ago
But I still have this aching need to hear your voice
To know your here
I don't seem to have any choice

Am i obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
I do all the time

Oh yeah

Im so sorry I just had to wake you up
I feel so lonely by myself
Is this the way you feel when your in love
Or is this something else?

Yeah

[Guitar Solo]


Am i obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
Want you all the time

Oh yeah

But I do all the time
I want you all the time
Am I obsessed?
With you..
