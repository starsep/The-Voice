We sign our cards and letters bff (Uh uh)
You've got a million ways to make me laugh(Yeah)
You're looking out for me
You've got my back
It's so good to have you around
You know the secrets I could never tell(Uh huh)
And when I'm quiet you break through my shell
Don't feel the need to do a rebel yell
Cuz you keep my feet on the ground

You're a true friend
You're here till the end
You pull me aside when somethin ain't right
Talk with me now and into the night
Till it's alright again
You're a true friend

You don't get angry when I change the plans
Somehow you're never out of second chances
Won't say I told you when I'm wrong again
I'm so lucky that I found

A true friend
You're here till the end
You pull me aside when somethin ain't right
Talk with me now and into the night
Till it's alright again

True friends will go to the ends of the earth
Til they find the things you need
Friends hang on through the ups and the downs
Cuz they've got someone to believe in

A true friend
You're here till the end
You pull me aside when somethin ain't right
Talk with me now and into the night
No need to pretend

Oh you're a true friend
You're here till the end
You pull me aside when somethin ain't right
Talk with me now and into the night
Till it's alright again
You're a true friend
You're a true friend
You're a true friend
