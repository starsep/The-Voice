So, may I have your attention?
Look in my direction,
Here youll see the sun never sets.
No, we dont have to worry,
Never in a hurry.
One by one the stars go to bed,
And I step into the spotlight again.

Cant help myself,
Ive got to be,
When lights are shining down on me.
I want to feel the sun.
So turn that walk into a run,
Gonna bring the party when I come.
Sing it out if you want to have some fun.

And into the spotlight we will go,
Follow me cause, baby, lifes a show.
Into the spotlight you will see
Its the only place to be.
(Cha,cha,cha)

Oh, musics like a magnet,
The best thing on the planet.
Its pulling us together again.
So, lets cause a commotion,
Sound waves on the ocean.
Wake a million; grab your best friend,
Lets step into the spotlight again.

Cant help myself,
Ive got to be,
When lights are shining down on me.
I want to feel the sun.
So turn that walk into a run,
Gonna bring the party when I come.
Sing it out if you want to have some fun.

And into the spotlight we will go,
Follow me cause, baby, lifes a show.
Into the spotlight you will see
Its the only place to be.

Turn it up,
If youre down hearted.
Let the music,
Get us started.
Gotta let it go once in a while.

Turn it up,
Theres nothing to it.
When its done,
Well just redo it.
Might as well have fun,
Have fun in this life.

Cant help myself,
Ive got to be,
When lights are shining down on me.
I want to feel the sun.
So turn that walk into a run,
Gonna bring the party when I come.
Sing it out if you want to have some fun.
