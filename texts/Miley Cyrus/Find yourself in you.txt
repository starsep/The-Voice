She never thought that she could
Get her second chance
Running so far from all she's ever known
Convinced she's last all meaning
Where did her dreams go
Still she knew that there was something more

Don't be scared, there's someone there
To say these words you need to hear

[chorus]
Don't let anybody tell you who you are
It's okay to let go, you're that shooting star
Remember all you wished for
Believe it will be true
You will never find yourself anywhere else
You'll find yourself in you

Sometimes people tell you
Be like me to fit in
Do you know your identity is not in them

Don't be scared there's someone there
To say these words you need to hear

[chorus]

Why should i measure the world
By someone else's design
Oh i won't let this fly by
Hey look over here i just found the real me
Now it's your turn to see
Now it's your turn to see

[chorus]
