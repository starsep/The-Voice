Oh yea
Come on

You get the limo out front (uau)
Have the styles, every shoe, every color

Yea when you're famous it can be kinda fun
It's really you but no one ever discovers

In some ways you're just like all your friends
But on stage you're a super star

You get the best of both worlds
Chillin' out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show

You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both worlds

The best of both worlds

You go to movie premiers (is that Orlando Bloom?)
Hear your songs on the radio
Livin' two lives is a little weird
But schools cool cuz nobody knows

Yea you get to be a small town girl
But big time when you play your guitar

You get the best of both worlds
Chillin' out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show

You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both
You know the best of both worlds

Pictures and autographs
You get your face in all the magazine
The best parts that you get to be whomever you wanna be

Yea best of both
You go the best of both
Come on best of both

Who would have thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstar

You get the best of both worlds
Chillin' out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show

You get the best of both worlds
Mix it altogether and you know that it's the best of

You get the best of both worlds
Without the shakin' the hair
You can go anywhere

You get the best of both girls
Mix it altogether
Oh yea
It's so much better cuz you know you've got the best of both worlds
