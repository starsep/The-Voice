Its easy to feel like you're all alone
To feel like nobody knows
The great that you are; the good that's inside you
Is trying so hard to break through

Maybe, it's your time to lift off and fly
You won't know if you never try
I will be there with you all of the way
You'll be fine

Don't!
Let!
Anyone tell you that your not strong enough
Don't give up!
There's nothing wrong with
Just bein' yourself, that's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice.
Speak your mind and make some noise!
And sing
Hey!
Hey!
Make some noise!
Hey!
Hey yeah!

You want to be known
You want to be heard, and know you are beautiful
You have so much to give; some change you wanna live
So shout it out and let it show
You have a diamond inside of your heart
A light that shines bright as the stars
Don't be afraid to be all that you are
You'll be fine

Don't!
Let!
Anyone tell you that your not strong enough
Don't give up!
There's nothin' wrong with
Just bein yourself thats more than enough
So come on and raise your voice..
Speak your mind and make some noise!..
And sing

Hey!
Hey!
Make some noise!
Hey!
Hey yeah!

You can't just sit back and watch the world change
It matters what you've got to say
There's no one else who can stand in your place
So come on it's never to late

Maybe, it's your time to lift off and fly
You won't know if you never try

Dont!
Let!
Anyone tell you that your not strong enough
Don't give up!
There's nothin' wrong with
Just bein' yourself that's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice.
Speak your mind and make some noise!
And sing
Hey!
Hey!
Make some noise!
Hey!
Hey yeah!
Hey!
Hey!
Speak your mind and make some noise
And sing
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Make some noise
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Make some noise
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Make some noise
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Make some noise
