Everybody makes mistakes,
Everybody has those days,
Everybody knows what, I'm talking about,
Everybody gets that way (That's right!)

Everybody makes mistakes,
Everybody has those days,
Everybody knows what, I'm talking about,
Everybody gets that way

[VERSE 1]
Sometimes I'm in a jam,
I gotta make a plan,
It might be crazy,
I do it anyway,

The way to know for sure,
I figure out a cure,
I'm patching up the holes,
But then it overflows,

[PRE-CHORUS]
If I'm not doin' too well,
Why be so hard on myself?

[CHORUS]
Nobody's Perfect!
I gotta work it!
Again and again,
Till I get it right,

Nobody's Perfect!
You live and you learn it!
And if I messed it up sometimes,
Nobody's Perfect,

[VERSE 2]
Sometimes I work a scheme,
But then it flips on me (Uh-huh),
Doesn't turn out how I planned,
Gets stuck in quicksand,

The problem can be solved,
Once I get involved,
I try to be delicate,
Then crash right into it,

[PRE-CHORUS]
But my intentions are good, (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Sometimes just misunderstood,

[CHORUS]
Nobody's Perfect!
I gotta work it!
Again and again,
Till I get it right (That's right!),

Nobody's Perfect!
You live and you learn it!
And if I messed it up sometimes,

Nobody's Perfect!
I gotta work it!
I know in time I'll find a way,
Nobody's Perfect,

Sometimes I fix things up,
And they fall apart again, (Nobody's Perfect)
I know I mix things up,
But I always get it right in the end,

[SPEAKING]
Next time you feel like,
It's just one of those days,
When you just can't seem to win,
When things don't turn out the way you planned,
Figure something else out,
Don't think ahead, Try again!

Everybody makes mistakes,
Everybody has those days,
Everybody knows what, I'm talking about,
Everybody gets that way,

Everybody makes mistakes,
Everybody has those days,
Everybody knows what, I'm talking about,
Everybody gets that way,

[CHORUS]
Nobody's Perfect!
I gotta work it!
Again and again,
Till I get it right,

Nobody's Perfect!
You live and you learn it!
And if I messed it up sometimes,

Nobody's Perfect!
I gotta work it!
I know in time i'll find a way,

Nobody's Perfect,
You live and you learn it,
Cause everybody makes mistakes,
Nobody's Perfect,

Nobody's Perfect,
No, No,
Nobody's Perfect!
