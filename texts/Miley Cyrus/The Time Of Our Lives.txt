Seems like were holding on forever (I gotta let it go) 

Times up, you're pushing me to surrender (Tonight) 

Who knows what happens now whatever (Where ever the wind blows) 

And I'm there as long as were together, Alright 



Let's have the time of our lives 

Like there's no one else around 

Just throw your hands up high 

Even when they try to take us down 

We'll have the time of our lives 

Til the lights burn out 

Let's laugh until we cry 

Life is only what you make it now 

Let have the time of our lives (lives, lives, lives, lives, lives, lives, lives) 



Dreamers don't don't care if it's right (I think I'm really into you) 

Best list let's leave it all behind (Tonight) 

Crazy when you cross my mind (All the trouble we could get into) 

So what, let's just give this a try, Alright 



Let's have the time of our lives 

Like there's no one else around 

Just throw your hands up high 

Even when they try to take us down 

We'll have the time of our lives 

Til the lights burn out 

Let's laugh until we cry 

Life is only what you make it now 

Let have the time of our lives 



Looking back at what I'll be waiting for 

Take that chance nows all we've got for sure (sure, sure, sure) 



Let's have the time of our lives 

Like there's no one else around 

Just throw your hands up high 

Even when they try to take us down 

We'll have the time of our lives 

Til the lights burn out 

Let's laugh until we cry 

Life is only what you make it now 

Let have the time of our lives
