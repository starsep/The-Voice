Smooth-talking
So rockin’
He’s got everything that a girl’s wantin’
Guitar cutie
He plays it groovy
And I can’t keep myself from doing something stupid

Think I’m really falling for his smile
Get butterflies when he says my name

He’s got something special
He’s got something special
And when he’s looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He’s got something special
He’s got something special
I can hardly breathe, something’s been telling me, telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one….

He’s lightning
Sparks are flyin’
Everywhere I go he’s always on my mind and
I’m goin’ crazy
About him lately
And I can’t help myself from how my heart is racing

Think I’m really digging on his vibe
He really blows me away

He’s got something special
He’s got something special
And when he’s looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He’s got something special
He’s got something special
I can hardly breathe, something’s been telling me, telling me maybe he could be the one

He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one…

And he’s got a way of making me feel
Like everything I do is
Perfectly fine
The stars are aligned when I’m with him
And I’m so into him…

He’s got something special
He’s got something special
And when he’s looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He’s got something special
He’s got something special
I can hardly breathe, something’s been telling me, telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one…
