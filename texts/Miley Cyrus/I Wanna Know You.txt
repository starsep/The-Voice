Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, Whoa

When I saw you over there,
I didn't mean to stare,
But my mind was everywhere,
I wanna know you

Gonna guess that you're the kind,
to say what's on your mind,
But you listen when I have something to show you.

There's a mark above your eye,
You got it in July
You're fighting for your sister's reputation

You remember people's names
Valentines are lame
So I bring you flowers just for no occasion

Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, Whoa

I wanna know you!

Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, Whoa

I wanna go there, where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road,
I'll sit back and say to my self, 'yeah I thought so'

You smile, never shout.
You stand out in a crowd
You make the best of every situation

Correct me if I'm wrong,
You're fragile and you're strong
a beautiful and perfect combination

Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, Whoa

I wanna know you

Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, Whoa

I wanna go there, where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road,
I'll sit back and say to myself

I like how you are with me
In our future history
And someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself,
'Yeah, I thought so'

I thought so

Ooh whoa
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah 
Yeah
whoa, whoa, oh
Yeah
whoa, whoa, oh
I wanna know you
yeah (whoa whoa oh)
yeah (whoa whoa oh)
I wanna go there, where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road,
I'll sit back and say to myself.
