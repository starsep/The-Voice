(With us)

Come on guys tell me what we're doing
We're hangin' around when we could be all over the pla-a-a-ace
The sun is shinin' just the way we like it
Let's get out of this hall
And show the world our fa-a-a-ace

It's friday but there's nowhere to go
Anywhere is cool but we're not going ho-ome
And we can do anything we wanna do
It's all up to me and you

Turn this park into a club, the stars are lights
And the moon is so bright from above
Skateboard's here, it's all right
So pull on up, everyone is waitin' for us

Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us We got the party with us We got the party with us

Radio, let me be a DJ
I'll turn you up, keep us movin' till we're on a ro-o-o-ole
Everyone is dancin' to their own beat
And lettin' go, everybody here's got a so-o-o-oul

It's friday and there's nowhere to be
We're kickin' it together it's so good to be fre-e
We got each other and that's all we need
The rest is up to you and me

Turn this park into a club, the stars are lights
And the moon is so bright from above
Skateboard's here, it's all right
So pull on up, everyone is waitin' for us

Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us
We got the party with us
Woo!
We got the party, we got the party!

Life is for dreamers and I'm a believer
That nothing can stand in our way
Today, the place to pla-ay -- yeah!

( yeah )

Turn this park into a club, the stars are lights
And the moon is so bright from above
Skateboard's here, it's all right
So pull on up, everyone is waitin' for us

Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us

Turn this park into a club, the stars are lights
And the moon is so bright from above
Skateboard's here, it's all right
So pull on up, everyone is waitin' for us

Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
