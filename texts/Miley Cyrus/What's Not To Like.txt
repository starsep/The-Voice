Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...

When your a superstar
They know your name where ever you are
Life is crazy and I like it

Pictures on magazines
Autographs and ninety thousand screams
Get the dream and then you live it

Oh, wouldn't you want that too?
Who could blame you?
Oh, cause what I say it's true, oh yeah

When your a VIP, you get what ever you please
What's not to like?
The fans screaming your name, all the fortune and fame
What's not to, What's not, what not to like?

Yeah, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...

Life in the spotlight
Designer clothes you wear one time
Tell me now who wouldn't love it?

Hollywood celebrity
Coast to coast sold out every CD
Loving every minute of it

Oh, wouldn't you want that too?
Who could blame you?
Oh, 'cause what I say it's true, oh yeah

When your a VIP, you get what ever you please
What's not to like?
The fans screaming your name, all the fortune and fame
What's not to like?
You party all the time, you get to live the life
What's not to, what's not, what not to like...?

Signing pictures to the end of the line
Smiling every time...
The song you want I'm here to sing
Feels good, gotta bring it
Radios, night shows, then the star in movie roles

Woo, what's not to like?
huh-oh, huh-oh

When your a VIP, you get what ever you please
What's not to like?
The fans screaming your name, all the fortune and fame
Doesn't that sound nice?
You party all the time, you get to live the life (live the life)
What's not to like? (oh)
When you're a superstar, everyone knows who you are
What not to, what's not, what's not to like?
