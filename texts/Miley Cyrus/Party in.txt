I hopped off the plane at LAX
with a dream and my cardigan
welcome to the land of fame excess, (woah)
am I gonna fit in?

Jumped in the cab,
Here I am for the first time
Look to the right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummys turnin and I\\\'m feelin kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I\\\'m nervous,
That\\\'s when the taxi man turned on the radio
and a Jay Z song was on
and the Jay Z song was on
and the Jay Z song was on

CHORUS:
So I put my hands up
They\\\'re playing my song,
And the butterflys fly away
Noddin\\\' my head like yeah
Moving my hips like yeah,
And I got my hands up,
They\\\'re playin my song
I know I\\\'m gonna be ok
Yeah, It\\\'s a party in the USA
Yeah, It\\\'s a party in the USA

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody\\\'s lookin at me now
Like \\\"who\\\'s that chick, thats rockin\\\' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town\\\"

So hard with my girls not around me
Its definitely not a Nashville party
Cause\\\' all I see are stilletos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummys turnin\\\' and I\\\'m feelin\\\' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I\\\'m nervous
That\\\'s when the D.J. dropped my favorite tune
and a Britney song was on
and the Britney song was on
and the Britney song was on

CHORUS:
So I put my hands up
They\\\'re playing my song,
And the butterflys fly away
Noddin\\\' my head like yeah
Moving my hips like yeah,
And I got my hands up,
They\\\'re playin my song
I know I\\\'m gonna be ok
Yeah, It\\\'s a party in the USA
Yeah, It\\\'s a party in the USA

Feel like hoppin\\\' on a flight (on a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)
Something stops me everytime (everytime)
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright!

CHORUS:
So I put my hands up
They\\\'re playing my song,
And the butterflys fly away
Noddin\\\' my head like yeah (Oh, nodding my head)
Moving my hips like yeah, (Ooh Yeah)
And I got my hands up,
They\\\'re playin\\\' my song
I know I\\\'m gonna be ok (gonna be okay)
Yeah (huh huh), It\\\'s a party in the USA (Yeah)
Yeah, It\\\'s a party in the USA

So I put my hands up
They\\\'re playing my song,
And the butterflys fly away (flying away)
Noddin\\\' my head like yeah (nodding my head like yeah)
Moving my hips like yeah, (moving my hips like yeah)
And I got my hands up,
They\\\'re playin\\\' my song
I know I\\\'m gonna be ok (I\\\'m gonna be okay)
Yeah (Yeah), It\\\'s a party in the USA
Yeah (hahaha), It\\\'s a party in the USA (Party in the USA!)
