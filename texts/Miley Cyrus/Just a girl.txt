Finally
I've been waiting for this moment,
For you to see the real me,
It's been an illusion,
But I never meant to fool you,
I got caught up in a fantasy.

I'm just a girl,
With a dream that got the best of me,
In a world that believes fame is everything,
But I touch with the ones that gave me my wings,
To fly, to fly.

People say,
That the world is like a stage,
Yes I'm confused, the roles I play,
I've been away from home for so long,
That i, almost forgot where i belong.

Im just a girl,
With a dream that got the best of me,
In a world that believes fame is everything,
But I touch with the ones that gave me my wings,
To fly, to fly.

It's so easy to forget,
what really matters in this life,
It's so hard to live with regrets,
But I promise I will try,
To be a better me,
From now on, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to do you wrong.

I'm just a girl,
With a dream that got the best of me,
In a world that believes fame is everything,
But I touch with the ones that gave me my wings,
To fly, to fly,
To fly, to fly.

You give me my wings,
So I can fly,
I can fly, yeah..

I'm just a girl
