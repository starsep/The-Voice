The other side, the other side, the other side of me

By day, I play, the part in every way
All simple,sweet,calm,and collected
Pretend, to my friends, I'm a chameleon
You make a girl feel disconnected

Feel like a star, a superhero
Sometimes its hard to seperate
(got too much on my plate)

If you could see
the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key, (the key) to both realities
The girl that I want you to know if only I could show
The other side, the other side, I want you to see (oh)
The other side, the other side, the other side of me

Inside, I try, to make the pieces fit right
A jigsaw puzzle everywhere,
cuz I flip(I flip), the script(the script), so many times I forget
Who's on stage, who's in the mirror

Back in the spotlight, the crowd is calling
the paparazzi and the fame
(they can drive a girl insane!)

If you could see, the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else can't you tell?
I hold the key, to both realities
The girl that I want you to know if only I could show
The other side, the other side, I want you to see
The other side, the other side, the other side of me

Down inside I'm not that different
Like everyone I have a dream
Don't wanna hide, just wanna fit in
sometimes
that is harder then it seems

If you could see, the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else can't you tell?
I hold the key, to both realities
The girl that I want you to know

If you could see, (come on!) the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else can't you tell?
I hold the key (the key), to both realities
The girl that I want you to know if only I could show

The other side, the other side, I want you to see (yeah)
The other side, the other side, the other side of me
The other side, the other side, I want you to see(oh)
The other side, the other side of me
