I'll tell you what we're gonna do,
What you need to know,
What you gotta get to get where you wanna go.
Never ever miss a noun,
Keep your eye on all displays.
When you find your style,
Everyday's a holiday.

I'll show you how to work in,
To find the fit that's perfect.
You know that you deserve it.
(Whoa, whoa whoa!)

This is the good life,
Take a good look have anything you want.
This is the good life,
Dining with your friends at the fancy restaurant.
Living the good life,
We have such a good time,
I know.

Grab a little Gucci bag,
And some Prada shoes.
Here, take my credit card,
They're all here to wait on you.
Jimmy Choo calls out your name,
D &amp; G on every wall.
When you can't decide,
That's okay just buy them all.

There's no better feeling.
(Oh!)
There's nothing more appealing.
(Hey, eh!)
The door, front, floor, the ceiling.
(Whoa, whoa, whoa!)
(Oh!)

This is the good life,
Take a good look have anything you want.
This is the good life,
Dining with your friends at the fancy restaurant.
Living the good life,
We have such a good time,
I know.

Can't be slow, never stop,
Fill those bags up to the top.
Turn around, try it on,
Now off to the hair salon.
Joanie says, "I'll just pay,
There's no need for layaway."
Slide your plastic, flash your cash.
Ring it up, it's such a blast.

(One, two, three, four!)

This is the good life,
(Good life!)
Take a good look have anything you want.
This is the good life,
(Good life!)
Dining with you friends at the fancy restaurant.
(Yeah!)
Living the good life,
We have such a good time,
(The good life!)
I know.

(Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, the good life.
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, I'm living the good life.
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, the good life.
(Good life!)
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, I'm living the good life.
Whoa, oh, whoo, the good life, yeah!)
