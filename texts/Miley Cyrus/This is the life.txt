Take the world, shaking, stirring
That's what I've got going on
I've thrown my cares up in the air
And I don't think they're coming down
Yeah, I know how it feels right now

This is the life
Hold on tight
And this is a dream
It's all I need
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time, ya
I'm still getting it right

This is the life
Hold on tight (hold on, on)
And this is a dream
It's all I need (hold on)
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time, ya
I'm still getting it right
This is the life

Gonna follow my own lead, Yeah!
Kick back and feel the breeze
Nothing but the blue sky
As far as I can see

This is the life
Hold on tigh!
And this is the dream
It's all I need
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time, yeah
I'm still getting it right

This is the life (Life! Yeah!)
Hold on tight (Hold on, hold on!)
And this is the dream (Dream!)
It's all I need (Hold on!)
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time, yeah
I'm still getting it right
This is the Life
