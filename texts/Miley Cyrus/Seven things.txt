Sha, sha, sha

I probably shouldn´t say this,
but at times I get so scared
when I think about the previous
relationship we shared.
It was awesome, but we lost it
it's not possible for me not to care.
And now we're standing in the rain
but nothing's ever gonna change
until you hear, my dear.

The 7 things I hate about you,
The 7 things I hate about you,
ohhh, you

You're vain, your games, you're insecure,
you love me, you like her,
you made me laugh, you made me cry,
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
when you act like them, just know it hurts;
I wanna be with the one I know.
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
you make me love you

It´s awkward and silent,
as I wait for you to say

What I need to hear now:
your sincere apology.
When you mean it I'll believe it;
if you text I'll delete it,
let's be clear.
ohhh, I'm not coming back
you're taking seven steps here

The seven things I hate about you

You're vain, your games, you're insecure,
you love me, you like her,
you made me laugh, you made me cry,
I don't know which side to buy,
Your friends, they're jerks,
when you act like them, just know it hurts.
I wanna be with the one I know.
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
you make me love you.

And compared to all the great things
that would take too long to write
I probably should mention
the seven that I like.

The seven things I like about you
your hair, your eyes, your old Levis
when we kiss I'm hypnotized.
You make me laugh,you make me cry
but I guess that both I'll have to buy.
Your hands in mine, when we're intertwined
everything's all right
I wanna be with the one I know
and the seventh thing I like the most that you do
you make me love you

Sha, Sha with you do ooh
ooooh oooooooh ooooh ohhh
