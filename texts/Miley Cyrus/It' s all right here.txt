Why would you rather be
Anywhere else with me
I tell you man it's all right here
(where ever we are, where ever we are)
Check out the scenery we won the lottery
I tell you man it's all right here

I can't believe you’d even think
Of being anyplace anyplace all right here
The grass may be greener in the end I swear
you’ll be wishing you were here if you were there
(wherever we are, wherever we are,
wherever we are, wherever we are)
It's all right here

[Spoken:]
“Excuse me officer”

If your smart you'll know you want to be
in the mix of white hot energies
It's all to welcome you
Talk so good it's moving way to fast
if were good I know we’ll make it last
It's all here for you
It's all here for you
It's all here for you
(wherever we are wherever we are wherever we are wherever we are)
It's all right here
It's all right here
It's all right here
(wherever we are wherever we are wherever we are wherever we are)
Come on
Come on lets go
It's all right here

In the open road
Will take us anywhere
And as long as I'm with you I wont care where
And we can choose the desert or the sea
Cause the good times are in front of you and me

Why would you rather be
Anywhere else with me
Ill tell you man it's all right here
(where ever we are, where ever we are)
Check out the scenery
We won the lottery
Ill tell you man it's all right here

I can’t believe you’d even think
Of being anyplace anyplace but right here
The grass may be greener in the end I swear
But you’ll be wishing you were here if you were there
You wish you were here
You wish you were here

And if I could make you want to stay just one more day
Maybe everything would be okay
Come on, Come on, Come on
It's all right here
wherever we are wherever we are wherever we are wherever we are
It's all right here
