Are you overloaded
Candycoated
Your life's imploding now
There's a risk worth taking
A pain worth aching
On this hollow ground
Let go
Don't go hold on to all of lifes hardest parts
When we pick a stop
Let's keep on rockin
To the rhythm of our hearts

We can
We can break outta here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can
Forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken

Find the magic
Go and grab it
Your fate is in your hands
Come on, find a reason to believe in
Just tell yourself we can

We can
We can break outta here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can
Forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken

Get off your seat
On your feet
Raise your hands
Feel the beat
Let it go
Lose control
Feel it in your soul
Don't you know what you can do
If you have faith in you
Let's not be invisible
There's no where lying
Let's just go

We can
We can break outta here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can
Forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken, yea-ea-ea-eah

We can
We can
We can
We can
We can, oh yeah
We can
We can
We can
We can
We can
We can
We can
We can

Good and broken
