Everybody needs inspiration
Everybody needs a soul
A beautiful melody
When the nights so long
'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy...

And when my world is falling apart
When theres no light to break up the dark
Thats when I, I, I
I look at you
When the waves are flooding the shore
and I can't find my way home anymore
Thats when I, I, I
I look at you

When I look at you
I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone!

Yeah
When my world is falling apart
When theres no light to break up the dark
Thats when I, I, I
I look at you
When the waves are flooding the shore
And I can't find my way home anymore
Thats when I, I, I
I look at you

You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kolidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need every 
Breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful
Yeah

When the waves are flooding the shore
And I can't find my way home anymore
Thats when I, I, I
I look at you
Yea, yea, yea

And you appear just like a dream to meeee
