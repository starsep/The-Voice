I've been in a rut
Back and forth enough
Heart like a wheel
Without you around
So uncomfortable is how it feels

Every time you're near
Trouble disappears
Under the ground
But when you go to far
Silver clouds will start hanging around
And I know why

Chorus:
Try to run
But I keep on
Coming back
Full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go

Try to want
So I keep on
Coming back
Full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around

Skippin down a broken path
How long can I last
Please let me know
Where's the finish line
'Cause I've got to find somewhere to go

I don't want to hear
People interfere
What do they know
What I feel inside
When I'm up all night
Needing you oh...

I don't know why
Try to run
But I keep on
Coming back
Full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go

Try to want
So I keep on
Coming back
Full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around

'Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around

I keep on runnin'
Til we meet in the middle
I put it right aside
And I care just a little
There's miles to go
But wait
Don't hold back
We'll make it

And I know why
Try to run
But I keep on
Coming back
Full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go

Try to want
So I keep on
Coming back
Full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around

I know you'll come around
You'll come around

Yeah I know you'll come around
You'll come around
