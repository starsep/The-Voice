I need to feel your heartbeat, when you say love me
I don't wanna hear it, it its something that you don't mean
If I had to leave you now
There would be an empty space
It doesn't matter anyhow
You can take your things, and go your own way

And there's two more lonely people
In the wold tonight
Baby, you and I.
And just two more lonely people.
Who give up the fight.
Yea, I'm alright.

Well, you know my heart is aching.
You don't have to break it.
If love don't change your mind.
Then there's two more lonely people, tonight.

I don't want the pictures.
I don't want your sympathy
We don't have to be friends.
We don't have to be enemies.
In my head I break it down
As I'm absolutely sure.
That you and I could work it out
Or we can kill the lights on What we had before

And there's two more lonely people
In the wold tonight
Baby, you and I.
And just two more lonely people.
Who give up the fight.
Yea, I'm alright.

Well, you know my heart is aching.
You don't have to break it.
If love don't change your mind.
Then there's two more lonely people.

Well, we got something special.
That should be enough
Nothing unpredictable when it comes to love. Oh.

Maybe, lately, baby I'm really rough
Oh if you walk away then i've...
Will be two more lonely people
In the wold tonight
Baby, you and I.
You're just two more lonely people.
Who give up the fight.

And there's two more lonely people
In the wold tonight
Baby, you and I.
And just two more lonely people.
Who give up the fight.
Yea, I'm alright.

Well, you know my heart is aching.
You don't have to break it.
If love don't change your mind.
Then there's two more lonely people, tonight.
