Everybody knows the bones,
Just had to find a way
Everybody know what I'm talkin 'bout,
That's how I'll get an A

My bod has many parts
And this is where it starts
Phalenges I have ten,
And Medditarsals then
I got some tarsals too,
I'll put them in my shoes
The Fibula is next,
According to my text
Then comes the tibia,
That ain't no fibia
And now I'm up to my knee
Yeah,Yeah,Yeah
Thats the petela to me

We're doin' the bone dance
We study the answers
Again and again till I get it right
We're doing the bone dance
Ya dance and you'll learn it
And we won't mess up this test
We'll get it perfect

When I milk the cow,
On uncle Earl's farm
I use the ulna bone,
That is in my arm
Moo Yah!!!!!

And now I take it home, with the Parital bone
It might be crazy,
But we learn that way
Temporal and Frontal too
And now we're finally through
That makes two hundred and six
I found a way that clicks
(chant)
Bone bugs in the house

We're doin' the bone dance
Ya study the answers,
Again and again till I get it right
We're doin' the bone dance
Ya dance and you'll learn it
And we won't mess up this test
We'll get it perfect
WORD!
