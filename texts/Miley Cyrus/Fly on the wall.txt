You don't understand what it is
That makes me tick but you wish you did 
You always second guess wondering
I say yes which it is 
Ozz out everytime
If you only knew what I talk about
When im with my friends just hanging out
Then you'd have the inside scoop
On what you see what to do
That way when we play the game
Maybe you could win the stay

Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall
A creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall
All my precious secrets yeah 
You know them all 
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall 

Youd love to know the things I do
When im with my friends and not with you
You always second guess wondering 
Those other guys or who im with 
You should know by now
If you were my boyfriend I'd be true to you
If I make a promise im coming threw
Don't you wish that you could see me every second of the day
That way you would have no problem with me .... 

Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall
A creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall
All my precious secrets yeah 
You know them all 
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall 

A little communication 
Common and go my way 
Getting in this situation
To much he said he say 

and what I say is

and what I wanna know is

Don't you wish 
Don't touch
Don't touch 
Don't you wish you were a

Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall
A creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall
All my precious secrets yeah 
You know them all 
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall
