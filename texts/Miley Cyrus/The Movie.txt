1,2,3,
Everybody come on off your seats
I'm gonna tell you
About a beat
That's gonna make you
Move your feet
I'II give the bar-b-cues
Show and tell you
How to move
If you're 5 or 82
This is something
You can do
Pop it,lock it
Polka dot it
Countrity then
Hip-Hop it
Put your hawk it the left,
Stick it,glide...
Pop it,lock it 
Polka dot it
Countrify then
Hip-Hop it 
Put your hawk in the sky 
Move side to side
Jump to the left,
Stick it,glide...


REFREN:

Zig Zag
Cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits
Hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist
And then a 
Zig Zag
Step,slide
Lean it out
Head to toe 
Thrrow it all together
That's how we roll
Do the hoedown,
Throwdown,
Do the hoedown,
Throwdown
Throw it all together
That's how we roll
