Sunrise and I lift up my head then I smile at your picture sitting next to my bed
Sunset and you\'re feeling okay cause you smile at the letter that I sent you today
Cant wait till I see you again and we both say remember when
The band played on the fourth of July and you held me on your shoulders way up high

Your still there for me
Wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us I'll send a message across the sea
That you can't sleep tonight knowing it's all right
I believe that you're listening to my song
You're with me
You've been here all along
You've been here all along

Back then you walked me to school told me to be careful and to follow the rules
Fast forward you taught me to drive you gave me the keys and we went for a ride
And I cant wait till I see you again and we both say remember when
I'm holding on to moments like that and I know that their coming back

Your still there for me
Wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us I'll send a message across the sea
That you can't sleep tonight knowing It's all right
I believe that you're listening to my song
You're with me
You've been here all along
You've been here all along

Yeah

All along the way I keep you in my heart and in my prayers
You'll always be the one who cares the most
Counting all the days
I see you running up to say, “ I missed you”
I missed you

Your still there for me
Wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us I'll send a message across the sea
That you can't sleep tonight knowing It's alright
I believed that you're listening to my song

Your still there for me
Wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us I'll send a message across the sea
That you can't sleep tonight knowing It's alright
I believed that you\'re listening to my song
You're with me
Cause you're with me
You've been here all along
You've been here all along
