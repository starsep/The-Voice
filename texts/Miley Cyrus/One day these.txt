Today I am not feeling lucky 
My phone is out of the area 
I am with pain in head 
And you do not help me 
Flying in the sky 
It can help, but with you 
It is much better 

Chorus: 
One day these, I can quit 
Crazy by street without reacting 
And you can win me 
And talk that loves me 
One day these I can slipping 
And drop-arm not to weep 
And I will be with you 
One day these, yeah 

If you want so, I will do so 
But my way of being: 
Nobody Change 
And you, with your face in this strange boy 
You can shake 
It will be different 

Chorus: 
One day these, I can quit 
Crazy by street without reacting 
And you can win me 
And talk that loves me 
One day these I can slipping 
And drop-arm not to weep 
And I will be with you 
One day these, yeah 

Do not follow me 
I am not going to achieve 
With this their evil taste 
In this way you react 
But, not to give wrong 
I will speak te boy 
Do not target me 
Why then, the beast takes 

And if you want to quit 
Will you go through what me and take 
It is not that easy 
And there will be 

Chorus: 
One day these, I can quit 
Crazy by street without reacting 
And you can win me 
And talk that loves me 
One day these I can slipping 
And drop-arm not to weep 
And I will be with you 
One day these, yeah
