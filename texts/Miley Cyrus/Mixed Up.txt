La La La
La de da de da
La La La

How come everything turns out
Leaving me with more doubts
I feel like I'm upside down
And I dont wanna be here
I go right, should have gone left
And I say things I should of not said
Look at me in this big mess
I dont wanna be here

Everything I do
Is making me more confused
Oh it used to be easy
All I had to be was me
Now I'm mixed up, everywhere I go
Somewhere that I dont know
Oh I'm hoping that I'm dreaming
Cus I'm sick of this feeling
I'm mixed up, somebody help me
La La La La de da
Tell me how to fix this
I'd trade my world for one wish
To go back to my other life
Oh and get it right

Everything I do
Is making me more confused
Oh it used to be easy
All I had to be was me
Now I'm mixed up, everywhere I go
Somewhere that I dont know
Oh I'm hoping that I'm dreaming
Cus I'm sick of this feeling
I'm mixed up, somebody help me

To hold me, To tell me
Everything is gonna be okay
Cus today it feels like
I wont make it to the top now
Dont know how to get outta this
So mixed up, somebody help me
La La La

Everything I do
Is making me more confused
Oh it used to be easy
All I had to be was me
I'm mixed up, everywhere I go
Somewhere that I dont know
Oh I'm hoping that I'm dreaming
Cus I'm sick of this feeling
I'm mixed up, somebody help me
Somebody help me
