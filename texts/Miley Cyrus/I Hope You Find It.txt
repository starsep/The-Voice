 These clouds are going nowhere baby, rain keeps coming down
I just thought I'd try to call you baby, for you've gone too far out of town
and I hope you that you get this message that I'm leaving for you
cause I hate that you left without hearing the words that I needed you to


And I hope you find it, what your looking for
and I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be, and so much more
and I hope your happy wherever you are
I wanted you to know that nothings gonna change that
and I hope you find it


Am I supposed to hang around and wait forever,
last words that I said that I was nothing but a broken heart talking baby
you know that wasn't what I meant
Call me up, let me know that you got this message that I'm leaving for you
Cause I hate that you left without hearing the words that I needed you to


And I hope you find it, what your looking for
and I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be, and so much more
and I hope your happy wherever you are I wanted you to know that nothings gonna change that, and I hope you find it

Whatever it is, I know that you miss it here
*Chorus*
And I hope you find it, what your looking for
and I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be, and so much more
and I hope your happy wherever you are I wanted you to know that nothings gonna change that

no no no
And I hope you find it
I hope you find it
